Because of his immense talent, television and film appearances, and millions of fans on TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube, it appeared that Vik was doing quite well for himself. As such, it came as a shock to many when <strong>Vik appeared in <a href=#>Netflix</a>'s docuseries, </strong><strong>Dancing for the Devil. </strong>Fans were not only confused but wondered what Vik was doing in the aftermath of the show.</p><p>Dancing with the Devil put a huge spotlight on 7M Films, the management company to which Vik was signed. <strong>7M was founded by the leader of Shekinah Church, Robert Shinn</strong>. Robert has been <strong>accused of being a cult leader</strong> by former members of the church for the way he spoke about religion and the money parishioners were expected to donate, ala Michelle Pfeifer's Breatharian experience that <a href=#>proved to be cult-like with controversial religious beliefs</a>. These members of the church included dancers who were brought into the fold after they signed with 7M Films. Some of these dancers sued Robert for forced labor, human trafficking, and fraud, and the case is expected to go to trial in the future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We will explore <strong>what happened to Vik White after appearing on Netflix's "dance cult" docuseries, </strong><strong>Dancing for the Devil.</strong> Then we will look at how Vik got involved with 7M Films and <strong>why Vik chose to keep his distance from Dancing for the Devil, </strong>since airing.</p><h2 id=what-happened-to-vik-white-after-appearing-on-netflix-39-s-dancing-for-the-devil>What Happened To Vik White After Appearing On Netflix's Dancing For The Devil</h2><h3 id=vike-white-is-a-dancer-and-influencer-for-a-living>Vike White is a dancer and influencer for a living</h3><p>At the end of May 2024, Netflix released its docuseries, Dancing for the Devil. The project had been in the works for two years and began after <strong>a family of one of the dancers signed by 7M Films spoke out on Instagram Live</strong> that they had not been in contact with their daughter since joining 7M or Shekinah Church.</p><p>The docuseries was supposed to initially <strong>revolve around that dancer, Miranda Wilking, and her family</strong>. But as the director and producers spoke with dancers who were once affiliated with 7M and Shekinah Church as well as other former church members, there was more of a story to tell.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the dancers who was also signed by 7M Films and was a member of the Shekinah Church, was Vik White. His <strong>videos appeared throughout the docuseries</strong>, showcasing his dancing with Miranda and her now-husband, James "BDash" Derrick.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/hq720-10-1.jpg><p>Vik used to have contact information associated with 7M Films on his social media platforms. <strong>MGMT@7MFILMS.COM was associated with his accounts as late as April 2024.</strong></p><p>However, these days, that has changed. The contact information is with <strong>Underscore Talent as of June 2024</strong>. Whether this means that Vik has cut ties with Shekinah Church and his former dancer friends who are still a part of the house of worship is unclear. This is because other dancers, including Miranda and BDash, who are still <strong>associated with Shekinah Church have also taken down any mention of 7M Films</strong> from their profiles as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/michelle-pfeiffer-fell-in-love-with-a-_very-controlling_-couple-who-convinced-her-to-join-a-deadly-cult-deposit.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title='A "Very Controlling" Couple Got Michelle Pfeiffer To Unknowingly Join A Deadly Cult'>A "Very Controlling" Couple Got Michelle Pfeiffer To Unknowingly Join A Deadly Cult</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Michelle Pfeiffer didn't realize she was in a cult until she met her first husband.</p><p>Furthermore, according to the docuseries, members of Shekinah Church were <strong>encouraged to cut ties with anyone who was not a member of the church</strong>. With videos being posted in May 2024 that feature Vik and BDash and Miranda and Vik dancing as well as the videos being filmed Robert's son, Isaiah Shinn, it looks as though <strong>Vik is still a part of the Shekinah Church and perhaps even with 7M Films</strong> as well.</p><h2 id=how-vik-white-got-involved-with-7m-films>How Vik White Got Involved With 7M Films</h2><p>Vik got involved with 7M Films after he was featured on, So You Think You Can Dance. At the time, Vik was just beginning to gain a following. While it may not be the over <strong>eight million followers on TikTok or the 3.5 million followers on Instagram</strong> Vik has today, he had fans that were in the 1.5 million range. Unfortunately, Vik was still struggling to make it. But, when Isaiah started to film the videos and <strong>Robert saw that there was money to be made from Vik and the other dancers Isaiah was working with</strong>, 7M Films was formed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/instar53206013-1.jpg><p>In 2021, Vik and several other dancers were signed to 7M Films. The content that was produced was nothing short of professional grade. This increased the followers for Vik and other dancers featured in the videos. What money Vik made from being signed, however, is in question.</p><p>As pointed out by former 7M dancers Kevin "Konkrete" Davis and Aubrey Fisher, the latter of whom was once also very close to Vik, a <strong>majority of the money that was paid to them by 7M would go back to Shekinah Church</strong> in one form or another.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/how-jennifer-aniston-got-involved-in-a-criminal-cult-with-ex-boyfriend-gerard-butler-front-back-deposit.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="How Jennifer Aniston Got Involved In A Criminal Cult With Ex-Boyfriend Gerard Butler">How Jennifer Aniston Got Involved In A Criminal Cult With Ex-Boyfriend Gerard Butler</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Jennifer Aniston and Gerard Butler didn't know they were engaging with a cult that trafficked its members.</p><p>Be it a percentage back to tithes and offerings, or a percentage to the management company for their fee, rent, and more, in the end, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Kevin and Aubrey claimed in the lawsuit that they saw very little of their money</a>. Kevin even stated that if dancers did not give their money to Robert and the church, they would be "cursed."</p><p>"Robert refers to himself as 'the Man of God' and preaches to Shekinah members ... that without submitting to him and without Shekinah, their lives will be cursed. Robert required full physical and economic ... control over Shekinah members."</p><p>Whether this was only Aubrey, Kevin, and the other dancers involved in the ongoing lawsuit against Robert who experienced this, is unknown. But, between the dancers and other members of the congregation who all worked for Robert's companies, be it at a flower shop, coffee shop, mortgage company, or real estate agency, that all <strong>claimed they made little to no money</strong>, it would seem unlikely that Vik would have been any different.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=vik-white-chose-to-keep-his-distance-from-dancing-for-the-devil>Vik White Chose To Keep His Distance From Dancing For The Devil</h2><p>While Vik was featured in Dancing for the Devil, he chose not to participate in the docuseries. He did not do any of the interviews, nor did he respond to any of the requests that producers had for him.</p><p>If Vik is still with 7M Films, it would make sense that he would not speak out against the company or Robert for the Netflix show. Given that, despite the lawsuits against Robert and 7M, the <strong>company continues to post content for the dancers and book engagements for its other entertainers</strong>, it is clearly still operational. Because of this, <strong>Vik is likely profiting either via exposure or monetarily, </strong>perhaps not having his net worth negatively impacted as <a href=#>Bethany Joy Lenz's was during her time in a cult</a>, by still being associated.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/instar53691040-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Additionally, <strong>Vik is also breaking into the entertainment industry</strong> with his role in Prime's, The Idea of You. The <a href=#>film was slammed for not being serious enough</a>, but the role Vik played to his strengths as a dancer while introducing his acting and singing talents. With a career that is moving upward, not acknowledging Dancing for the Devil and looking distanced from Robert and 7M Films is a smart move. Whether it is for appearance or not, makes no difference. There is nothing that Vik could gain by saying anything about the docuseries. As such, <strong>to further his career, Vik has remained mum.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since Dancing for the Devil premiered, <strong>Isaiah has not shot any of the content for Vik</strong>. The last date that the content was posted was on May 14, 2024. The <strong>videographer Vik has used since being on the East Coast in June 2024, is Anthony Steverson.</strong> Steverson does not appear to have any affiliations with 7M Films or Shekinah. Whether this is intentional or simply done because Vik is filming outside of California is unclear. But unless Vik has cut ties with 7M Films and Shekinah Church in the last several weeks, it becomes more clear that Vik is saying nothing about his ties to Robert, the church, or the management company because he is still very much involved.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/how-winona-ryder-broke-free-from-a-cult-her-fans-didn-t-even-know-she-was-in-deposit.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="How Winona Ryder Broke Free From A Cult Her Fans Didn't Even Know She Was In">How Winona Ryder Broke Free From A Cult Her Fans Didn't Even Know She Was In</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Fans of Winona Ryder, who is beloved for starring in Reality Bites and Beetlejuice, likely have no idea that she lived in a commune as a child.</p><p>How being affiliated with Robert, despite the allegations against him, will affect Vik, is unclear.
