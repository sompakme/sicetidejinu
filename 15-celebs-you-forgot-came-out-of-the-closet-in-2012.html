Each season there are new scandals and tabloid stories, but some of the most empowering media blitzes are those that surround a celebrity embracing their sexuality and coming out of the closet. In some cases the celebrity was never hiding their sexuality, it just wasn’t an issue that they thought had to be announced publicly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Other more tragic cases involve someone getting outed with scandal or being forced out of the closet by bloggers in the way that Lance Bass was. But however the person came out, the fact that they celebrated their sexuality openly likely served as an inspiration for a kid out there that was too scared to tell the truth to their own loved ones. In 2012 society started to see homosexual people as equals instead of ‘not to be talked about’ scourges on society.</p><p>Fights for gay rights had been long underway and people were just starting to listen. This list of LGBTQ celebs has helped to create a positive view of gay people in Hollywood which only added to the fight as gay marriage became legal in 2015.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=15-paul-iacono><strong>15.

As a young man, he had his fair share of hard times after being diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. After receiving treatment the young actor has been in remission since he was 11 years old. Iacono attended Professional Performing Arts School in New York where he first met one of his future costars Paul McGill (Fame).</p><p>In a Springtime interview with Michael Musco of The Village Voice Iacono revealed that he was gay. He is currently dating Mason Amelotte, a student at Columbia University. The year after his interview with Musco Iacono was put on OUT Magazine’s 100 Most Influential LGBTQ people of 2013. The young man has been an activist for gay rights since coming out and remains an influential member of the queer community.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=14-gillian-anderson><strong>14. Gillian Anderson</strong></h2><p>Award winning actress <a href=#>Gillian Anderson</a> is best known for her role on hit sci-fi television series The X-Files, she played Agent Scully. She got her start on the stage before landing her role on television alongside <a href=#>David Duchovny</a>. In the 90s Anderson married her first husband to which she bore one young daughter. They were divorced a few years later and in the later 00’s she married once more in a ceremony off the coast of Kenya. They, too, were divorced and Anderson is currently single living in London with her three children.</p><p>The proud feminist revealed in a 2012 interview with OUT Magazine that she has been a part of a few same-sex relationships in her past. Although she identifies now as completely heterosexual, the actress isn’t opposed to taking on a same-sex relationship in the future. Basically, if two human beings become interested in each other she sees no issue with them exploring that despite their gender.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=13-wade-davis><strong>13.

Davis is the executive director of the You Can Play Project where he works to remove homophobia from the sports world. He works creating programs, curriculum, training and opening conversations which bring inclusion and diversity into sports.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=12-drake-jensen><strong>12. Drake Jensen</strong></h2><p>Canadian country star Drake Jensen was born in Nova Scotia and was heavily influenced by his mother’s love of country music. As a young man Jensen was heavily influenced by Merle Haggard, George Strait, Ronnie Milsap, John Conlee and Charlie Pride. In 2012 Jensen came out of the closet in order to shed a light on the tragedy that can occur from LGBTQ bullying. After Ottawa teen Jamie Hubley committed suicide as a direct result of bullying Jensen dedicated the video for his title track on “On My Way To Finding You” to the LGBTQ teenager. That year he also released the song “Scars” written by Don Graham and Zita DeSilva and donated all proceeds from the album to Bullying.org. At the end of 2012, the country star released a cover of Tammy Wynette’s classic hit “Stand By Your Man” with a video that featured drag star William Belli from RuPaul’s Drag Race.

Mitch from Paranorman</strong></h2><p>When Paramount Pictures released Paranorman&nbsp;the right wing blew a gasket over Mitch, the first openly gay animated character to hit the big screen. The writer and director of the animated feature about zombies Chris Butler said that featuring Mitch in the story goes with the theme of Paranorman: breaking through stereotypes and misconceptions. They wanted us to look at zombies that we usually think are going to eat our brains and think for a minute, check out the dumb jock neighbor and realize that he could also be a gay man; the creators of the film wanted to challenge our smaller views of the world. There were mixed reviews about Mitch when the film came out but ultimately Paranorman&nbsp;was still a modest box office success. In 2013 GLAAD nominated ParaNorman&nbsp;for its&nbsp;GLAAD Media Awards, and in the process made it the very first PG animated movie to be nominated at this awards ceremony.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=6-paul-babeu><strong>6.

Undocumented immigrant Jose Orozco went public with a story that he and Babeu had been lovers since they met online in 2006. Orozco went farther to say that Babeu knew Orozco was undocumented and the sheriff threatened deportation if the man didn’t remain silent after the relationship ended. A few days after this revealing media blitz Babeu spoke up and claimed that he was in fact gay and that was the only true fact in Jose Orozco’s story. Babeu stopped his bid to run for Congress and instead sought reelection as sheriff, which he won by a wide margin. Babeu is running for Congress this year in 2016 despite his own sisters backing his opponent Tom O’Halleran.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=5-frank-ocean><strong>5.

Her real breakout series was reality show Worst Cooks in America where she helped America’s least talented cooks pick up some basic skills.</p><p>Burrell claimed that she never kept her sexuality a secret so it’s impossible that she be outed, but the first public statement about her sexuality was from cookbook author Ted Allen on a radio show. After that interview, Burrell released a statement to the New York Post confirming that she is a lesbian and informing the world that she’s in a happily committed relationship with chef Koren Grieveson.
