After all, <a href=#>Gosling has starred in several blockbuster movies</a> and <a href=#>he is set to make his MCU debut in a roundabout way</a>.</p><p>Despite Gosling's Hollywood success, he seems to care a lot more about the family he has built with Eva Mendes even though <a href=#>he panicked when he learned he'd be a father</a>. With that in mind, it is fascinating to see how Gosling's career and family came together early in his life. The reason for that is that Burt Reynolds was taken with how "beautiful" Gosling's mom was.</p><p>This article will look at how <strong>Ryan Gosling's mom affected his relationship with the Hollywood legend, Burt Reynolds</strong>. Then, the article will look at the fact that <strong>Meryl Streep once complimented Gosling's mom's looks</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ryan-gosling-thought-he-bonded-with-bury-reynolds-but-the-hollywood-legend-really-liked-his-mom>Ryan Gosling Thought He Bonded With Bury Reynolds But The Hollywood Legend Really Liked His Mom</h2><p>Decades before Ryan Gosling played Ken in Barbie, he was just a child actor who was still trying to become a star. At that stage in Gosling's career, he appeared in a mostly forgotten movie titled Frankenstein and Me.</p><p>Even though virtually nobody remembers Frankenstein and Me, the movie also featured the Hollywood legend Burt Reynolds. In May 2024, Gosling appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! and discussed working with Reynolds.</p><p>During Gosling's discussion with Kimmel, he revealed that he initially thought Reynolds liked him. However, the Barbie star later figured out that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Reynolds simply thought the Gosling's mom was hot</strong></a>.</p><p>"I thought he took a shine to me. I thought he thought there was something special about me. And then I realized that I have a really beautiful mom. He was just kind of interested."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/instar49634032-1.jpg><p>On the one hand, it is very easy to see why Gosling would be upset to figure out Reynolds was attracted to his mom, Donna Gosling. After all, most teens would be freaked out to learn that anyone was interested in their mom. Worse yet, Gosling thought Reynolds took an interest in him, but it was his mom he was after.</p><p>On top of the fact that Ryan Gosling got to meet Burt Reynolds when he worked on Frankenstein and Me, the movie was important to him for another reason. According to MovieWeb, Frankenstein and Me was the first movie Gosling ever starred in.</p><p>On the other hand, Gosling told Kimmel that Reynolds' affection for his mom <strong>allowed the Barbie star to have a relationship with the legend</strong>. While Gosling labels that relationship as a "secondary shine", he had access to a true Hollywood star when he was still making his first movie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I was getting like a secondary shine.

While that may have happened, that isn't what Gosling told Kimmel about.</p><p>Who has Ryan Gosling been confirmed to have been involved with, according to Who's Dated Who?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Relationship:</p></th><th scope=col><p>Beginning:</p></th><th scope=col><p>End:</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>Sandra Bullock</p></td><td><p>March 2001</p></td><td><p>December 2002</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Rachel McAdams</p></td><td><p>December 2004</p></td><td><p>November 2008</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Eva Mendes</p></td><td><p>August 2011</p></td><td><p>Currently Married</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Instead, Gosling told Kimmel that Reynolds gave him advice about his love life.

I was like, 'I'm 13. I don't know what any of those things are. I don't know what any of that is. Stop looking at my mom.

One of the reasons for that is Norton's ability to get his guests to tell amazing stories that they'd kept to themselves for years.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ryan-gosling-and-ana-de-armas-on-the-red-carpet.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="The True Nature Of Ana De Armas' Relationship With Ryan Gosling Was Questioned Due To One Flirty YouTube Video">The True Nature Of Ana De Armas' Relationship With Ryan Gosling Was Questioned Due To One Flirty YouTube Video</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>After a video dedicated to Ana De Armas and Ryan Gosling's relationship was uploaded on YouTube, some viewers questione if the actors shared feelings.</p><p>When Ryan Gosling appeared on The Graham Norton Show in 2017, he told a story that was a perfect example of that. During that appearance, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gosling revealed he got Meryl Streep to compliment his mom's looks</a> in 2007, according to a People article.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Gosling attended the 2007 Academy Awards, he got his mom to come with him.</p><p>As Gosling revealed on Norton's show, he got his mom to sport a beehive hairdo since he thought that was going to be the rage at the Oscars that year. However, when they got to the awards show, everyone seemed to be wearing their hair down.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/ryan-gosling-and-his-mom-donna-gosling.jpg><p>According to Gosling, his mom felt very self-conscious at the event because of her beehive hairdo. Worse yet, Gosling said his mom felt even more out of place because her hair was blocking Rachel Weisz's view.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fortunately, Gosling revealed to Norton and his audience that he came up with a way to make his mom feel better. Gosling spoke to Meryl Streep, explained the situation, and asked her to compliment his mom's hair. According to Gosling, <strong>Streep handled the situation brilliantly</strong>.</p><p>"I didn’t know what to do ’cause I was — I wanted to have a nice night, so I didn’t know Meryl Streep but she was sitting next to me and I said in a commercial break, ‘Would you mind just telling my mom you like her hair?’ And she was like, ‘I got this.’ And then the commercial went and she goes, ‘Do you know, I was gonna do a beehive and I wish I had.’ And my mom was like, raise the roof all night.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipspmeYrSwv8uipaBlnaS6bq7Uq6tmqpWuu7C4w6xkq52clsGqu82sn6KoXw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fryan-gosling-had-a-strange-relationship-with-burt-reynolds-because-of-the-barbie-actor-s-beautiful.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fryan-gosling-had-a-strange-relationship-with-burt-reynolds-because-of-the-barbie-actor-s-beautiful.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fryan-gosling-had-a-strange-relationship-with-burt-reynolds-because-of-the-barbie-actor-s-beautiful.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fryan-gosling-had-a-strange-relationship-with-burt-reynolds-because-of-the-barbie-actor-s-beautiful.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fryan-gosling-had-a-strange-relationship-with-burt-reynolds-because-of-the-barbie-actor-s-beautiful.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fryan-gosling-had-a-strange-relationship-with-burt-reynolds-because-of-the-barbie-actor-s-beautiful.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./sssniperwolf-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./sssniperwolf-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Sssniperwolf Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./gavin-degraw-net-worth-therichest.html>Gavin DeGraw Net Worth | TheRichest</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./gavin-degraw-net-worth-therichest.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
