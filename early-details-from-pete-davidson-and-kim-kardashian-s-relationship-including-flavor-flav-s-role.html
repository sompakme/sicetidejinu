Ever since the "Aladdin and Jasmine" Disney sketch on Kim's <strong><a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a></strong> hosting gig, the pair began spending a lot of time together, but never actually gave fans information about their relationship. The whole thing became difficult for fans to deal with, because the pairing came as a surprise to everyone. But now, it's hard to deny how intriguing it is seeing the comedian and the reality star spend time together and form a closer bond.Something that may be considered by many as even more shocking is that the first official picture of Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson together was posted by famous rapper Flavor Flav. This has led to fans asking questions the rapper’s involvement with the purported couple.<span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kim Kardashian And Pete Davidson Break The New Year Apart As Pete Hosts NYE Party In Miami</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3></h3><h2 id=kim-kardashian-and-pete-davidson-s-bond-may-have-started-with-a-simple-kiss><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Kim Kardashian And Pete Davidson's Bond May Have Started With A Simple Kiss</span></h2><p>The exact time Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson began hanging out is a blur to most, however, many speculations have pointed towards the <a href=#>Disney sketch scene when the pair held hands and locked lips on a magic carpet</a>. In fact, only a few weeks after that kiss, fans spotted the pair holding hands on a roller coaster, while on what appeared to have been a double date with Travis Barker and <strong><a href=#>Kourtney Kardashian</a></strong> at Buena Park, California. Shortly after news got out, a source told People, "They hang in the same circles so they will be together from time to time. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">It's just friends hanging out.</a>"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kim-and-pete-s-relationship-went-from-friends-hang-out-to-private-dinner-dates><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Kim And Pete's Relationship Went From 'Friends Hang Out' To Private Dinner Dates</span></h2><p>At this point, it was either our minds were playing tricks on us or something was actually going on between Pete Davidson and Kim Kardashian. Following the pair being spotted holding hands, they were later reported to have been on a private dinner date at an Italian restaurant in New York's Staten Island.</p><p>A source close to the pair came forward to Page Six to share that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pete Davidson had a dinner reservation setup privately on the rooftop</a>, and also added that they didn't have any security with them, to reduce the chances of being spotted. Around this time, a report by E! News went out sharing what it is Kim may have seen in Pete. It read, "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pete is a very chill and casual guy, and she likes that.</a> They have plans to see each other again while Kim is in New York City.

They did this with some very light PDA, as they were seen holding hands while walking down a street. This basically set the record straight for many onlookers and made people aware that something was going on between Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=pete-davidson-rsquo-s-birthday-came-with-a-huge-surprise><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Pete Davidson’s Birthday Came With A Huge Surprise</span></h2><p>Only a day after Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson were spotted in town holding hands, the pair took things to a new level, as the first official picture of them together was posted.

According to Kim K., Pete had been talking about how much he liked rapper Flavor Flav and to show Pete how much he meant to her, she invited the rapped over for his birthday.</p><h2 id=flavor-flav-the-birthday-present><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Flavor Flav, The Birthday Present</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While in an interview with ET, Flavor Flav, the talented musician and hype man, confirmed that<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> he was indeed at Pete’s birthday for a special reason</a>. In his words, “When it comes down to Pete Davidson and Kim Kardashian, first of all, to me, that is family, you know what I'm saying. And the whole night I was so honored to be in their presence. One thing that I could say is Pete Davidson loves himself some Flavor Flav. Everything he does is, 'Flavor Flav this, Flavor Flav that, Flavor Flav this, Flavor Flav that.' So, Kim said, 'OK, well, for your birthday, you are going to have Flavor Flav.' She sent for me and that's how I ended up there.”</p><p>Flavor Flav also added that he was touched by how much love Pete Davidson had for him and to show this, he did something he’d never done before in his entire life. The star said “I was the birthday gift. And check this out, being that that man had so much love for me, I did something for the first time ever in my life. I took my clock from around my neck and I gave it to him, and I never gave a clock to nobody.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Is Kim Kardashian And Pete Davidson's Relationship A PR Stunt?</a></span></p><h2 id=flavor-flav-s-opinion-on-kim-kardashian-and-pete-davidson-s-relationship><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Flavor Flav's Opinion On Kim Kardashian And Pete Davidson's Relationship</span></h2><p>Speaking on his time spent with the King of Staten Island star, Flavor Flav was asked for his opinion on what was going on between Kim Kardashian and Pete Davidson based on his first-hand experience with the pair.</p><p>He said, “When it comes down to Pete Davidson and Kim Kardashian's relationship, only them two know it best. They just invited me into the circle, but I really don't know the full [story]. And plus besides, that's Kim and Pete, man. I would rather them tell about their situation than me.
