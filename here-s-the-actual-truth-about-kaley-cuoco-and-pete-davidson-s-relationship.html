Now that <a href=#>Kaley Cuoco is getting divorced</a>, fans wonder what happened and if she's going to find love again sometime soon. And since she's filming a movie with Pete Davidson, who recently <a href=#>split up with Phoebe Dynevor</a>, people are wondering if there's something romantic going on. They both seem thrilled to have starred in this movie and they've each posted about it on their Instagram accounts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Let's take a look at what we know about their relationship.</p><h2 id=good-friends>Good Friends</h2><p>Now that fans have seen <a href=#>Kaley Cuoco and Pete Davidson's Meet Cute set photos,</a> people are curious about what kind of relationship they have and if a love story is on the horizon.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaley Cuoco and Pete Davidson have a good friendship</a> and according to E! News, a source explained to the publication that they became pals while filming the romantic comedy Meet Cute. The movie is directed by Alex Lehmann and stars Kaley as Stella, a woman who keeps going back in time to alter the dates that she goes on, and Pete plays Gary, her love interest.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The source said, "She is close friends with Pete. She thinks he is hysterical and very sweet. They've gotten to know each other well. She has a lot of fun with him and they enjoy hanging out."</p><p>While this seems to be the truth of their relationship, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fans assume they're in a relationship</a>, according to BuzzfeedNews. A source talked about their "chemistry" that people could see on the set of Meet Cute.</p><p>There are many reasons why it would be great news if Kaley and Pete did start dating in the future. While they're both known for starring in funny movies and have great acting talent, they have also been through a lot with past relationships, and it would be sweet to see them in a better situation.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This 'SNL' Star Got Pete Davidson Cast On The Show</a></span></p><p>After the film shoot was over, Kaley posted a photo of her and Pete on social media and wrote, "That's a wrap on 'Meet Cute'!! What an experience! Loved every single human involved with this special little gem of a film."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another reason why fans wonder if there's more to the story here? According to Us Weekly, they connected on the film set since they have both been through splits recently. A source said, “Kaley and Pete have bonded a lot while filming so much so that they’ve become very good friends. They’re very supportive of each other and there’s no doubt they’ve been staying in touch post-filming.”</p><p>Kaley Cuoco hasn't had an easy time with love. Kaley and her first husband Ryan Sweeting got married in 2013, and according to Nicki Swift, Ryan moved into Kaley's house the day after they had their first date. She has admitted that she moves fast when she wants to do something.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kaley and her second husband Karl Cook also recently shared that they're getting divorced. They were married for three years and a source explained to People that they were experiencing "growing apart," also mentioning her "big career."</p><p>Kaley has also had some other high-profile romances. According to Us Weekly, she dated Henry Cavill briefly in 2016, Paul Blackthorne in 2015, and she and her Big Bang Theory co-star Johnny Galecki were even in a two-year relationship.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kaley Cuoco Has Deleted Her Estranged Husband From Social Media And Denied Spousal Support</a></span></p><h2 id=pete-39-s-romantic-history>Pete's Romantic History</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans of SNL star Pete Davidson have also been following his love life for a while as it's definitely not without drama. He made headlines for dating Ariana Grande and getting engaged super quickly, and he has also dated several other celebrities, from Kate Beckinsale to Larry David's daughter Cazzie David.</p><p>It makes sense that, given the many people that Pete Davidson has dated, that he says he's a "hopeless romantic" and told People via video, "I believe in true love and I believe in love and I think love is a great thing and I hope I’m fortunate enough to find that one day." Fans definitely hope that he will find someone and if that's Kaley Cuoco, it seems like that would be great news.</p><p>Pete also said in an interview on The Breakfast Club radio show that he lets his new partners know a lot about him and makes sure that honesty is his top priority.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Truth About Pete Davidson And Adam Sandler's Relationship</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Kaley Cuoco and Pete Davidson are friends, fans do wonder if something more will happen between them, and it would be really adorable if it did.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Kaley Cuoco Botched This Stunt In ‘The Flight Attendant’</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiimqSVrnqkwc6cpmaZnpl6sbHTnmSdmaaesbS7zaxkq52clsGqu82sn6KoXZmutbXNoGSrrZ2kv7R5w6KtqKqTmnw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhere-s-the-actual-truth-about-kaley-cuoco-and-pete-davidson-s-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhere-s-the-actual-truth-about-kaley-cuoco-and-pete-davidson-s-relationship.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhere-s-the-actual-truth-about-kaley-cuoco-and-pete-davidson-s-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhere-s-the-actual-truth-about-kaley-cuoco-and-pete-davidson-s-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhere-s-the-actual-truth-about-kaley-cuoco-and-pete-davidson-s-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhere-s-the-actual-truth-about-kaley-cuoco-and-pete-davidson-s-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-old-is-tiny-texie-net-worth-ethnicity-explored.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-old-is-tiny-texie-net-worth-ethnicity-explored.html>How Old Is Tiny Texie: Net Worth &amp;amp; Ethnicity Explored</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./8-worst-wwe-factions-and-7-that-we-want-to-see-more-of.html>8 Worst WWE Factions (And 7 That We Want To See More Of)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./8-worst-wwe-factions-and-7-that-we-want-to-see-more-of.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
