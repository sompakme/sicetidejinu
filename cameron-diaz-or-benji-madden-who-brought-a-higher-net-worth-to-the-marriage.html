While they have an impressive combined net worth of $180 million, one can't help but wonder who contributes to it more. It's safe to say that both stars have their career peaks behind them and aren't as relevant today — but one of them is certainly far wealthier than the other!</p><h2 id=benji-madden-rose-to-fame-in-the-early-2000s-with-the-band-good-charlotte><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Benji Madden Rose To Fame In The Early 2000s With The Band Good Charlotte</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Let's start off with the fact that Benji Madden rose to fame in the early 2000s as the lead guitarist and backing vocalist for the rock band Good Charlotte which released their self-titled debut album in 2000. However, it wasn't until the release of their second studio album titled The Young and the Hopeless in 2002 that their fame skyrocketed, with hits like "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous", "The Anthem", and "Girls & Boys". In 2004 the band released their third studio album The Chronicles of Life and Death which featured hit singles like "Predictable" and "I Just Wanna Live".</p><h2 id=while-cameron-diaz-became-a-hollywood-star-in-the-39-90s><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>While Cameron Diaz Became A Hollywood Star In The '90s</span></h2><p>While Benji Madden rose to fame in the early 2000s, actress Cameron Diaz rose to fame in the 1990s. The actress started out as a model and in 1994 she had her acting debut in the comedy The Mask opposite Hollywood star Jim Carrey.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Cameron Diaz And Benji Madden Have Been Married Since 2015: Here's What Else We Know</a></span></p><p>At the time, Cameron Diaz was 21 years old.

The band — who has up until that point had released five studio albums — decided that they need a break. In 2016, Good Charlotte came back with the release of their sixth studio album Youth Authority. In 2018 the band released their seventh studio album Generation Rx. However, while the band surely still had numerous fans, their peak success remains in the 2000s — at least for now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=while-cameron-diaz-decided-to-quit-acting-in-2014><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>While Cameron Diaz Decided To Quit Acting In 2014</span></h2><p>Cameron Diaz was a mega-successful actress all throughout the 2000s as she starred in blockbusters like Vanilla Sky,Charlie's Angels and Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, the Shrek franchise, In Her Shoes, and The Holiday.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Praise Cameron Diaz And Drew Barrymore For Aging With Grace Instead Of Botox</a></span></p><p>In the early 2010s, fans could see the actress in movies like Bad Teacher, What to Expect When You're Expecting, The Other Woman, and Annie. However, in 2014 — after the release of Annie — <a href=#>Cameron Diaz decided to take a break from acting and she hasn't returned to it ever since</a>.

In December of that year, the two got engaged and they tied the knot on January 5, 2015, at a ceremony in Diaz's home in Beverly Hills, California. Despite their seven-year age difference — Diaz is currently 49 while Madden is 42 — the two have managed to remain happily married for almost seven years. While they don't keep their relationship secret, they do tend to keep their private life out of the spotlight.</p><h2 id=currently-benji-madden-has-a-net-worth-of-40-million><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Currently, Benji Madden Has A Net Worth Of $40 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While there is no doubt that both stars have had very successful careers — only one of them is the richer one.
