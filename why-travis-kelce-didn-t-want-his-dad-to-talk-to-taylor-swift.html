Kelce and Swift began sparking dating rumors earlier this year when Kelce revealed he had intended to slip Swift his phone number during one of her shows on The Eras Tour. Soon after, Swift began appearing at Travis Kelce's Kansas City Chiefs' football games, and the internet exploded.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ttweb_how-travis-kelce-s-net-worth-is-being-affected-by-his-taylor-swift-romance_bk_a1_v3.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="How Travis Kelce’s Net Worth Is Being Affected By His Taylor Swift Romance">How Travis Kelce’s Net Worth Is Being Affected By His Taylor Swift Romance</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift going public meant Kelce's bank account was going to see a major bump.</p><p>Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift's relationship sparked mixed feelings by fans. Some love seeing Swift cheer him on and get excited when pictures appear online of their outings. Others, however, wish that Swift was not a focus during Chiefs' games. Regardless, it is interesting to watch Swift interact with those closest to Kelce while he's on the field. This includes Travis Kelce's parents, but Kelce wishes his dad had avoided Swift for this reason.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-travis-kelce-didn-39-t-want-his-dad-talking-to-taylor-swift>Why Travis Kelce Didn't Want His Dad Talking To Taylor Swift</h2><p>With the camera always on her, fans have witnessed Taylor Swift interact with Travis Kelce's inner circle during football games. While that mostly includes his friends and <a href=#>Patrick Mahomes' wife Brittany</a>, both of Travis Kelce's parents have also been in attendance.</p><p>However, Kelce wished that his father, Ed Kelce, specifically, had not spoken with his new love interest. "If you know dad like I know dad," Kelce began saying on his podcast New Heights.</p><p>"<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He shouldn't be talking to Taylor Swift</a>," Jason Kelce finished the train of thought.</p><p>Ed Kelce, father of the two football players, was seen with Taylor Swift in a suite at the Chiefs vs. Broncos game on October 12th, 2023. This was the third game Swift had attended to cheer on Kelce.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/taylor-swift-10.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Taylor Swift Worries Her Schedule Will Hurt Romance With Travis Kelce As She Flies Across The Country To Be With Him">Taylor Swift Worries Her Schedule Will Hurt Romance With Travis Kelce As She Flies Across The Country To Be With Him</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Taylor is having to put in a lot of travel to make things work with Travis, and it's apparently beginning to concern her.</p><p>On the podcast, Travis Kelce said it was "terrifying" to think about what they could have been talking about.

Ed gave an exclusive interview to People and revealed that he adored the singer and thought she was "very genuine."</p><p>"I'll tell you something <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">very special that I noticed about Taylor the first time I met her</a>," Ed told the outlet. "We're sitting in the suite, she gets up and in the front room, she gets up to go get a drink or something and she starts picking up empty bottles, cans, plates that are scattered around."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/taylor-swift-7.jpg><p>"And I'm just thinking, I don't think she got the diva memo. She didn't get the spoiled musician. She doesn't know how to pull that off. And that really to me said a whole lot."</p><p>Ed had previously told People that when he learned his son was seeing the musical artist, he began doing research on Swift. He wanted to know what kind of person she was, so he watched many of her old interviews. Ed was pleasantly surprised to see how kind-hearted Swift is as a person.</p><p>"She's very smart. I mean, very. That comes through right away."</p><h2 id=how-travis-kelce-39-s-mom-donna-kelce-feels-about-taylor-swift>How Travis Kelce's Mom, Donna Kelce Feels About Taylor Swift</h2><p>Taylor Swift has only briefly interacted with Ed Kelce, but she has spent a lot more time cheering on Travis Kelce with his mother, Donna. Fans of Taylor Swift loved seeing her interact with Donna, and they thought it was incredibly special for them to bond in that way.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is unclear, however, how Donna feels about the singer.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">When asked on the Today Show how it was to hang out with Swift in the suite</a>, Donna simply said, "It was okay."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/th-image-template-24.jpg><p>​​​​​​​</p><p>The short response worried some fans, especially when she later revealed that she was not a fan of Taylor Swift's music before meeting her.</p><p>Since the interview with the Today Show, however, Donna has said some kind words about Swift. It seems she just does not want to speak on her son's relationship considering it is still so new, and would rather the focus be on Travis Kelce's skill as an athlete.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=travis-kelce-and-taylor-swift-39-s-love-story>Travis Kelce And Taylor Swift's Love Story</h2><p>The love story between football star Travis Kelce and pop sensation Taylor Swift all began in July 2023, when Kelce brought up the "Anti-Hero" singer on his podcast, hosted with his brother, Jason Kelce, called New Heights.</p><p>"I was a little butthurt I didn't get to hand her one of the bracelets I made for her," Travis Kelce revealed to his brother on the show. Travis made her a friendship bracelet "with my [phone] number on it." Friendship bracelets are a staple of The Eras Tour.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/taylor-swift-wearing-black-onstage.jpg><p>Travis Kelce certainly managed to capture Swift's attention with the comment, because she later accepted an invitation to a Kansas City Chiefs game. She was seen cheering on Kelce on from a private suite, accompanied by Kelce's mother, Donna Kelce. Swift and Travis were seen leaving the locker room together after this game.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Swift has since continued to attend Chiefs games, and they have been spotted going on numerous dates.

But<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> it's obvious to her friends they're heading in that direction</a>," an insider close to Taylor Swift revealed to Us Weekly.
