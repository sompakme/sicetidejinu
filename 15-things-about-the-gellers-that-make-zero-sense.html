Friends was a hit TV show in the 90s that was focused on a group of six adults in their late 20s, trying to navigate through life in New York City when it came to dating, friendship, employment, and more. The Geller family added a lot of interesting moments to the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=p1>If it wasn’t for the hilarious Geller parents on friends, we wouldn’t understand why Ross and Monica turned out the way that they did. There are a few things about this family unit they don’t really make a lot of sense. For example, the fact that Monica dated one of her dad’s best friends is super weird. Most families cannot relate to a situation as awkward as that. Continue reading to find out everything else that doesn’t make sense about this family.</p><h2 id=would-jack-and-judy-make-it-so-obvious-that-they-favor-ross-over-monica-irl><span class=item-num>15 </span><span>Would&nbsp;Jack And Judy Make It So Obvious That They Favor Ross Over Monica IRL?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/jack-judy.jpg><p class=p1>It’s common knowledge that parents are not supposed to show favoritism between their kids! That’s why it’s so weird and interesting that Jack and Judy Geller made it obvious that they prefer Ross over Monica.
