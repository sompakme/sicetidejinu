The comedic actor has repeatedly expressed how he prefers to keep his personal life private. He's even mentioned that people get surprised by how serious he actually is behind the camera. So it's understandable that many fans have forgotten about the&nbsp;Bruce Almighty star's short-lived relationship with&nbsp;Renée Zellweger back in 2000. But of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">all Jim Carrey's exes</a>, many of whom he had longer relationships, it's still Zellweger who he considers his "last great love."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"She definitely was special to me, very special... I think she's lovely," Carrey said about the Academy Award-winning actress in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with Howard Stern</a>. Stern asked if the two-time Golden Globe award winner was telling the truth when he wrote that Zellweger was the "last great love of his life" in his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">satirical autobiography&nbsp;Memoirs and Misinformation</a>. Stern also said that perhaps Carrey wrote that to express his regrets on his relationship with the Judy star.</p><p>But here's the real story about their relationship...</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="The Reason Jeff Daniels Was Forced To Shoot Scenes Without Jim Carrey In 'Dumb And Dumber'" href=#>The Reason Jeff Daniels Was Forced To Shoot Scenes Without Jim Carrey In 'Dumb And Dumber'</a></span></p><h2 id=how-did-jim-carrey-and-ren-e-zellweger-meet>How Did Jim Carrey And Renée Zellweger&nbsp;Meet?</h2><p>Carrey and Zellweger got to know each other well on the set of&nbsp;Me, Myself & Irene&nbsp;in 1999. However, the Bridget Jones's Diary star said that they had met prior to that. She said she'd met him at a dinner party two years before. She said they also had common business associates and friends. But it was on the Farrelly brothers' film that&nbsp;The Mask&nbsp;star&nbsp;really saw the actress. One half of the director duo, Bobby Farrelly said that Carrey "flipped for [Renée] immediately."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately for the actor, Zellweger is not the type who dates co-stars. Peter Farrelly said that this got Carrey "sick over her" that he had to say, "hey she's not that great" to make him feel better. After they wrapped the film, the two eventually started speaking on the phone. At that time, rumors of them dating started going around. The Jerry Maguire&nbsp;leading woman said that it made her mad. However, when she got home after denying the speculations, she said she started missing the Liar Liar star.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title='Renee Zellweger And Ex Bradly Cooper Have Their "Jennifer Aniston And Brad Pitt" Moment At The Oscars' href=#>Renee Zellweger And Ex Bradly Cooper Have Their "Jennifer Aniston And Brad Pitt" Moment At The Oscars</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-was-jim-carrey-and-ren-e-zellweger-s-relationship-like>What Was Jim Carrey And Renée Zellweger's Relationship Like?</h2><p>Zellweger and Carrey had a honeymoon type of affair. At that time, the&nbsp;Yes Man openly gushed about his relationship. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He told Entertainment Weekly</a> that the&nbsp;Miss Potter&nbsp;actress&nbsp;was "absolutely a gem of a human being" who kept him grounded. What Carrey ultimately loved about the multi-award-winning actress was that "she thinks having a good time is renting a U-Haul and taking furniture to Texas,"&nbsp;The Truman Show&nbsp;star said. "She's real in that way and I absolutely love it." The actress also described their relationship as an "unexpected, wonderful thing."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The couple instantly became a fan favorite at the 2000 Golden Globes when Carrey had received an award for his performance in&nbsp;Man on the Moon. The lovebirds were spotted walking the red carpet in the rain, holding their own umbrella and just having the best time together. It was simple, but it's exactly what captured the fans' hearts. Usually, celebrities have assistants during those instances guarding them or holding their umbrella for them. But Carrey and Zellweger were all smiles, posing for the paparazzi. Not a care in the world.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Alec Baldwin Does A Great Donald Trump, But SNL Fans Aren't So Sure About Jim Carrey's Joe Biden" href=#>Alec Baldwin Does A Great Donald Trump, But SNL Fans Aren't So Sure About Jim Carrey's Joe Biden</a></span></p><h2 id=why-did-jim-carrey-and-ren-e-zellweger-break-up>Why Did Jim Carrey And Renée Zellweger Break Up?</h2><p>The couple called it quits in December 2000.&nbsp;Grinch&nbsp;director Ron Howard said that they were pressured by the media's increased attention to their relationship. Zellweger's side revealed, however, that the couple "wanted different things." Classic celebrity answer, right? But some fans assumed that maybe it had something to do with Carrey being a father to his then 13-year-old daughter, Jane Erin Carrey.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was also rumored that the two actually got engaged at some point. But Zellweger denied it. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She told Cosmopolitan</a>, "It was all made up... As if I would consider marriage after only three months." The&nbsp;Chicago&nbsp;actress added that half the time they were dating, she was in England shooting&nbsp;Bridget Jones's Diary. Clearly, their work schedules had also taken a toll on the relationship.</p><h2 id=what-s-jim-carrey-and-ren-e-zellweger-s-relationship-like-now>What's Jim Carrey And Renée Zellweger's Relationship Like Now?</h2><p>Carrey and Zellweger seemed to have ended things on good terms.

But I do appreciate the people that have come through&nbsp;my life for the good that they gave me." Isn't that sweet?
