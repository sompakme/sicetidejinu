On top of a myriad of accolades awarded to the cast and crew for their excellent storytelling, the series has also impacted the lives of those who participated in it in very significant ways. For instance, Chrissy Metz has been one of the stars in the illustrious ensemble cast on the show. When she was first cast in the role of Kate Pearson in This Is Us, she reportedly only had 81 cents in her bank account. Today, she compares favorably in the ranking of those among her colleagues <a href=#>with the highest net worth</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sterling K. Brown plays another leading role, as Kate's brother, Randall. The Black Panther actor is very passionate about diversity on television, which is something the <a href=#>producers of This Is Us have taken very seriously</a>.</p><p>With similar stories shared among the rest of the cast and the fans as well, there has been a sense of loss since NBC announced that the current sixth season would be the last of the show. In reality, this is just the fulfillment of a plan that was hatched from the very beginning.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'This Is Us' Actor Sterling K.

He might not have revealed this publicly at the beginning of the journey, but the cast were reportedly made aware that this was the intention.</p><p>It was Sterling K. Brown who first revealed this, when he sat down with Good Housekeeping to discuss <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Season 6 finale</a>. "We have been building towards something from the beginning, and now we have a chance to finish off the artistic vision that Fogelman had," Brown said.
