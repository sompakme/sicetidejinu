Both his albums and his songs chart<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> high on the Billboards</a> every year, with no signs of slowing down. He gets to work with some of the best musicians in the world (everyone ranging from Drake to Ozzy Osbourne), and he even has his own festival named after his most recent album.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, he's directly linked to Hollywood's biggest family empire because he had a child with one of its members. However, that's<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> only one of many relationships</a>&nbsp;that Travis Scott has been a part of.</p><p>After all, let's not forget that Travis Scott is a superstar. As many music stars do, he has had a lot of romantic liaisons. To say that Travis Scott has had "many" romances would be an understatement. Let's take the time to list out all of the ones we know about.</p><h2 id=rihanna><span class=item-num>13 </span><span><strong>Rihanna</strong></span></h2><p>Back in 2015, multiple reports from multiple outlets and sources emerged, which all said the same thing -&nbsp;Travis Scott and Rihanna were dating! Not just fooling around or having a fling, but openly dating in public. Both seemed to be serious about being together, and multiple people in their circles were hoping it would turn into something bigger. But alas, it just was not meant to be between them after all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Travis Scott Secretly Dated Rihanna... This Is Why It Was Kept Quiet</a></span></p><h2 id=dascha-polanco><span class=item-num>12 </span><span><strong>Dascha Polanco</strong></span></h2><p>Most readers recognize her best as Daya from Orange is the New Black, but Dascha Polanco was linked to Travis Scott. This was back in 2015. Per reports from Life & Style Magazine and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Crazy Days and Nights</a>, the two had a fling. At the time, she was under the impression that Scott was single, only to find out later that he had a similar fling with another "A+ list singer"...12 hours later. That A+ list singer? It was allegedly Rihanna.</p><h2 id=rubi-rose><span class=item-num>11 </span><span><strong>Rubi Rose</strong></span></h2><p>A musician in her own right...and a video girl best known for appearing in the "Bad and Boujee" music video for Migos...Rubi Rose was first linked to Travis Scott in 2014. It was only in late 2019, in a YouTube&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with Vlad TV</a>, that she confirmed dating Scott when she was much, much younger.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=justine-skye><span class=item-num>10 </span><span><strong>Justine Skye</strong></span></h2><p>Once upon a time, Kylie Jenner was best pals with model and rapper, Justine Skye. The reported reason they stopped being besties was Skye's decision to break the girl code by dating Travis Scott after he had already broken up with Kylie Jenner. Just like that, years of friendship were tossed away.</p><h2 id=kendall-jenner><span class=item-num>9 </span><span><strong>Kendall Jenner</strong></span></h2><p>This one takes us into rumor territory, but it's such a strange rumor that it deserves some reflection. Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sources at Celebuzz</a>, Travis Scott briefly had a fling with Kendall Jenner before moving on to Kylie. His alleged intention was to "work his way through the entire extended Kardashian family," with Kourtney being next on his hit list.</p><p>Whether this was true or not, Travis' relationship with Kylie proved to be far more healthy and mature than expected, even though it didn't last.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Rumors Kendall Jenner Wishes Would Quietly Disappear</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sza><span class=item-num>8 </span><span><strong>SZA</strong></span></h2><p>Sticking to speculation for one more second, the sizzling chemistry that the two artists shared on the song, "Love Galore", and the music video that came along with it, was more than enough to get people guessing. A lot of people thought that these two did more than just record music in the studio together.</p><h2 id=rojean-kar><span class=item-num>7 </span><span><strong>Rojean Kar</strong></span></h2><p>Back in 2019, fans of the singer and his baby mama may recall that there was a bizarre drama where Travis and Kylie had some sort of an argument that inspired him to delete his Instagram page for a short while.</p><p>In the&nbsp;kerfuffle, fans noticed that Kylie blocked an Instagram model named Rojean Kar. Rojean had a "friendship" with Travis Scott that dates all the way back to 2013, judging by an Instagram post where he gifted her with a giant teddy bear. It sounds a little personal for nothing but a friendship to have happened between them!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-mystery-woman><span class=item-num>6 </span><span><strong>The Mystery Woman</strong></span></h2><p>Back in 2017, pictures surfaced of Travis Scott leaving Wiz Khalifa's birthday party with a mystery woman. Even to this day, no one knows exactly who this so-called mystery woman could be, in relation to Travis. No one knows if this was truly a woman he was romancing - which would be awkward since he was still with Kylie at this time - or if looks truly are deceiving and they were just friends.</p><h2 id=karrueche-tran><span class=item-num>5 </span><span><strong>Karrueche Tran</strong></span></h2><p>Karrueche Tran has been linked to celebrities like Chris Brown and footballer, Victor Cruz, but one celeb that gets overlooked and forgotten in her burn book is Travis Scott. During New York Fashion Week in 2016, the two were spotted hugging and kissing each other at a Vera Wang event, despite Tran denying the two were dating.</p><p>Whatever did or didn't happen between them behind closed doors, it seems as though they continued being friends, as she was spotted supporting him&nbsp;as recently as 2018, where she was seen in attendance at his Astroworld event.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything There Is To Know About Kylie Jenner And Travis Scott's Relationship With Stormi</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tinashe><span class=item-num>4 </span><span><strong>Tinashe</strong></span></h2><p>Thanks to a lewd GQ cover that the two shared while barely clothed, speculation began that Tinashe and Travis Scott were dating, mostly because they were both shirtless and groping each other's bodies. It could just be a case of good acting mixed with convincing modeling, or a case of art imitating real life.</p><h2 id=chantel-jeffries><span class=item-num>3 </span><span><strong>Chantel Jeffries</strong></span></h2><p>In 2015, rumors went wild that Chantel Jeffries and Travis Scott were dating, after both decided to post similar, yet vague messages on Snapchat, claiming to miss someone. Neither confirmed who their respective 'someones' were, but since they posted at around the same time, fans put two and two together.</p><p>As it turned out, reports surfaced afterward of the two hanging out; Jeffries appeared at many of his concerts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hailey-baldwin><span class=item-num>2 </span><span><strong>Hailey Baldwin</strong></span></h2><p>In 2017, before she accepted a ring from Justin Bieber, Hailey Baldwin was in the trenches with Travis Scott. Fans first speculated they were dating when she posted a curious photo of them in a kitchen; Travis was without a shirt. Even more curious, she ended up starring in a music video with him, for "Goosebumps", which was never released. One has to wonder why he wanted her as a muse so badly in the first place.</p><h2 id=kylie-jenner><span class=item-num>1 </span><span><strong>Kylie Jenner</strong></span></h2><p>Of course, we can't talk about Travis Scott's dating history without ending with the mother of his child. The two first sparked dating rumors after&nbsp;cozying up with each other at Coachella in 2017 - then, before we knew it, a pregnancy confirmed it. While the two themselves are no longer dating, they are able to co-exist and co-parent for the sake of their daughter, Stormi.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kylie Jenner And Travis Scott's Relationship Timeline (And Where They're Going Next)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicr52irsGptc2gZLCdXaC7sMOMmpmoraRiwbOt1aKqZquTpMG1v4ypmKysXaeyra3Toqanq5ievbR7</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2feverything-we-know-about-travis-scott-s-past-relationships.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2feverything-we-know-about-travis-scott-s-past-relationships.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2feverything-we-know-about-travis-scott-s-past-relationships.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2feverything-we-know-about-travis-scott-s-past-relationships.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2feverything-we-know-about-travis-scott-s-past-relationships.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2feverything-we-know-about-travis-scott-s-past-relationships.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-to-open-eau-thermale-avene.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-to-open-eau-thermale-avene.html>How to open eau thermale avene</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./chick-mcgee-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html>Chick McGees Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./chick-mcgee-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
