<time>06 Jul 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>B.J. Novak is probably most known for playing the role of Ryan Howard on the hit comedy series, The Office. What many fans may not know is that the actor is multi-talented and has written a children's book, directed his own feature film, and even co-owns a pop-up restaurant in West Hollywood. Unlike his character on The Office, Novak is actually pretty successful at the endeavors he's gone after.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything We Know About Mindy Kaling And BJ Novak's Relationship</a></span></p><p>Novak is reportedly worth $10 million, and not all of that cash came from the hit comedy series, believe it or not. The writer and actor has been working non-stop on various projects since the hit series ended. The Office was the start of his career, and it helped him launch a life after the series as a successful writer, producer, and director.</p><h2 id=bj-novak-wrote-and-directed-a-feature-film><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>BJ Novak Wrote And Directed A Feature Film</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Novak recently wrote, directed, and stars in a feature film titled Vengeance. Most of the film was shot before COVID-19 hit, but they had to go back and shoot the rest once production was able to resume in New Mexico. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The film received rave reviews from critics</a> and fans alike, with some fans stating it was the best film they had seen all year. It tells the story of a big city man who winds up in Texas attending the funeral of a girl he once hooked up with. A bunch of twists and turns later, his character learns a very important lesson, and so does the audience.</p><h2 id=bj-novak-produced-a-show-on-hulu><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>BJ Novak Produced A Show On Hulu</span></h2><p>Novak wrote and produced a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">mini-series on Hulu called The Premise</a>. Each episode told a different story, and the stories were often a bit odd, but that's normal for Novak. An anthological series, the show told various stories featuring some of the biggest issues of our time. Episodes featured stars such as Jon Bernthal and Ben Platt.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>BJ Novak Just Directed His First Movie, Here's Everything You Need To Know</a></span></p><h2 id=bj-novak-wrote-a-children-39-s-book><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>BJ Novak Wrote A Children's Book</span></h2><p>Novak wrote a hugely successful children's book called The Book With No Pictures. Novak has toured the country, reading his book to kids, who laugh out loud whenever he makes the funny sounds in the book. The entire purpose of the book is to get adults to read it to their kids and make fun of themselves in the process by reading the funny sounds. The book doesn't need pictures at all. Genius, right?</p><h2 id=bj-novak-executive-produced-the-mindy-project><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>BJ Novak Executive Produced The Mindy Project</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Novak was credited as an executive producer for the first season of The Mindy Project, starring his best friend, Mindy Kaling. The series went on for several seasons on FOX and eventually made the jump over to Hulu for several more seasons. Novak only served as a producer for one season, but he also guest-starred on a few episodes over the course of the series' run.</p><h2 id=bj-novak-co-owns-a-pop-up-restaurant><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>BJ Novak Co-Owns A Pop-Up Restaurant</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/bj-novak-today-show.jpg><p>Novak teamed up with chef Tim Hollingsworth to launch a pop-up restaurant in West Hollywood that serves up-scale versions of foods from various chain restaurants. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">restaurant is called Chain</a> and they do random drops of food and alert people via text message when they can make a reservation. Drops sell out super fast, so it can be hard to get a reservation, but that just means the pop-up is crazy popular and super successful. They currently charge $40 per person.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Scream For A Wedding After Mindy Kaling's Happy Birthday Post To BJ Novak</a></span></p><h2 id=bj-novak-has-the-office-money><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>BJ Novak Has The Office Money</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/bj-novak-the-view.jpg><p>Not only did Novak star on The Office for eight out of the nine seasons as Ryan Howard, but the actor also served as a writer for those eight years as well as a producer for seasons two through eight. It's also worth mentioning that the show is heavily syndicated and also streams on Peacock with extended versions of super-fans of the show to view.</p><h2 id=bj-novak-wrote-a-book><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>BJ Novak Wrote A Book</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/bj-novak-hollywood.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Novak wrote a successful book of short stories that are, much like The Premise on Hulu, kind of odd and random but are quite funny. The book is titled One More Thing. Some of the stories are only a few lines, while others take up multiple pages. It is one hundred percent Novak's sense of humor. In a video interview with The New York Times, Novak stated that while he's a working actor, he's always thinking with the mind of a writer. He also said that he was inspired by the book Lolita, which he read when he was 17 and he was blown away by how the book was so well-written and funny, but was written for the reader and not so much about class.</p><h2 id=bj-novak-has-acted-in-many-projects><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>BJ Novak Has Acted In Many Projects</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/bj-novak-the-view-2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Novak has starred in several successful films over the years including The Founder, which was about the creator of McDonald's, Inglorious Basterds, starring Brad Pitt, and Saving Mr. Banks, where he played the legendary Robert Sherman. He also appeared as Alistair Smythe in The Amazing Spider-Man 2. As far as television goes, aside from The Office, Novak appeared in several episodes of the hit drama series, The Newsroom, The Mindy Project, and Crazy Ex-Girlfriend.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dl7duus6vmKRllZa%2Fr7HDZp%2Biq11mfW65yKWjoqeeYrumwIywpqusmGQ%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-bj-novak-earned-his-10-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhow-bj-novak-earned-his-10-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhow-bj-novak-earned-his-10-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhow-bj-novak-earned-his-10-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-bj-novak-earned-his-10-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-bj-novak-earned-his-10-million-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jana-kramer-and-husband-allan-russell-s-honeymoon-photos.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jana-kramer-and-husband-allan-russell-s-honeymoon-photos.html>Jana Kramer and Husband Allan Russell's Honeymoon Photos</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./here-s-what-other-celebs-have-said-about-madonna-good-and-bad.html>Heres What Other Celebs Have Said About Madonna (Good And Bad)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./here-s-what-other-celebs-have-said-about-madonna-good-and-bad.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
