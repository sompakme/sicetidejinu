Even though the family members have each amassed a high net worth since first becoming famous, they don't have an easy time. In this article, we'll take a look at <strong>the relationships between the stars of Little People, Big World</strong>, along with how the cast members make money.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=inside-the-little-people-big-world-cast-members-39-dramatic-family-relationships>Inside The Little People, Big World Cast Members' Dramatic Family Relationships</h2><p><strong>Little People, Big World season 25 premiered on February 27th, 2024</strong> and viewers learned that <strong>Matt Roloff and his kids struggled to get along</strong>.

According to Just Jared Jr., the cast of Little People, Big World all have fairly high net worths. <strong>Amy Roloff and Matt Roloff have $6 million net worths</strong>. Their children Molly Roloff, Zach Roloff, Jeremy Roloff, and Jacob Roloff all have net worths of $700,000.</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Name Of Each Roloff Family Member</p></th><th scope=col><p>Relation (According to People)</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>Matt Roloff</p></td><td><p>father</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Amy Roloff</p></td><td><p>mother</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Zach Roloff</p></td><td><p>son/twin brother to Jeremy</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Jeremy Roloff</p></td><td><p>son/twin brother to Zach</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Molly Roloff Silvius</p></td><td><p>daughter</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Jacob Roloff</p></td><td><p>youngest son</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Matt also said:</p><p>"We don't see Zach and Tori that often.

This seems to be when the family tension became really bad and was the last straw for Zach. He told the cameras:</p><p>“The family wasn’t put first on multiple occasions [so] that ship all sailed.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/caryn-chandler-matt-roloff.jpg><p><strong>Matt Roloff's engagement to Caryn Chandler</strong> also caused problems with Zach Roloff. According to People, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the couple got engaged in April 2023</a>. Zack didn't appear to be supportive, which hurt Matt's feelings. This is another reminder that families can upset each other no matter how much money they have in the bank.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Matt and Amy Roloff also had a hard time with their relationship in Little People, Big World season 25. When they worked on a fundraiser, Matt felt that Amy was being bossy and said she becomes a "micromanager to dictator quicker than me."

But stars on a documentary series such as Little People, Big World earn $1,500-$3,000 per episode. If the show gets more seasons, they might get paid $7,000-$1,000 per episode.

According to Distractify, Amy made quite a bit of money when Matt purchased her share of their farm several years ago. In 2019, <strong>Matt Roloff paid Amy Roloff $667,000 for part of the farm</strong>, and in 2020, he paid her $975,000 for 32.28 acres.</p><p>What Are Amy Roloff's Books?</p><ul><li>"Short and Simple Family Recipes" (2012)</li><li>"A Little Me" (2019)</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/jeremy-roloff-s-wife-audrey-angered-countless-little-people-big-world-fans-who-were-already-worried-about-their-marriage.jpg><p>Amy also makes money from the two books she published. She would have made money from the book deals themselves and then likely made money from royalties.</p><p>Jeremy and Zack Roloff also likely earn an income from the podcasts that they have with their wives. Jeremy hosts "These Are The Days" with Audrey and Zack hosts "Raising Heights" with Tori. While the amount that they make is unclear, they are famous enough that they can likely attract advertisers, which could allow them to take home some cash from podcasting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijoqykobJuvMSop6WdXZe2qHnWqKmlnF2YrrTAjKecrWWnpL%2B1tIyfmKahnK56s7HLmquip56otaq8jg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2feven-the-little-people-big-world-cast-s-net-worth-can-t-fix-their-fractured-family-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2feven-the-little-people-big-world-cast-s-net-worth-can-t-fix-their-fractured-family-relationship.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2feven-the-little-people-big-world-cast-s-net-worth-can-t-fix-their-fractured-family-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2feven-the-little-people-big-world-cast-s-net-worth-can-t-fix-their-fractured-family-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2feven-the-little-people-big-world-cast-s-net-worth-can-t-fix-their-fractured-family-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2feven-the-little-people-big-world-cast-s-net-worth-can-t-fix-their-fractured-family-relationship.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jon-secada-s-if-you-go-lyrics.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jon-secada-s-if-you-go-lyrics.html>Jon SecadasIf You Go Lyrics</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./bow-wow-finally-admits-to-being-a-father.html>Bow Wow Finally Admits To Being A Father</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./bow-wow-finally-admits-to-being-a-father.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
