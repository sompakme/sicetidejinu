Things <a href=#>weren't always smooth behind the scenes</a>, and some <a href=#>guests were tough to deal with</a>, but each week, the show <a href=#>listened to its audience</a>, and it was able to keep its place at the top for years on end.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The show had amazing characters, and they all made great contributions to the show's legacy. For the most part, they were good people, but all of them had a darker side that came out every now and again.</p><p>Monica Geller might have been nice at times, but fans have pinpointed her worst moment. We have all the details below!</p><h2 id=39-friends-39-is-an-iconic-show>'Friends' Is An Iconic Show</h2><p>From September 1994 to May 2004, Friends was a juggernaut on NBC that cemented its place in history as one of the best and most loved sitcoms of its era. Sure, there were plenty of other amazing things to watch during the '90s, but millions of fans simply could not get enough of those 6 pals living out in New York.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The cast boasted a ton of young talent, and for a decade, fans got to watch them play iconic characters who all grew up and ventured to different paths in life. The show certainly had its over-the-top moments, but it was relatable on so many levels, which really helped drive its success all those years ago.</p><p>Thanks to the show's writing, the characters felt real, and the performance given by the cast in each episode helped take things to another level. This combo is what keeps people hooked after their first watch.</p><p>While the characters did make the show thanks to having so many amazing moments, the truth is that they all showed some ugliness more than a few times.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jennifer Aniston Revealed How She Really Dealt With The End Of 'Friends'</a></span></p><h2 id=monica-wasn-39-t-the-only-with-forgettable-moments>Monica Wasn't The Only With Forgettable Moments</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Well-written characters aren't always good, nor are they always bad. There needs to be somewhat of a dichotomy there, and thankfully, the lead characters on Friends all had some bad moments to help balance out the good.</p><p>For example, Joey is a character that is universally loved, and while he's normal good, he had a moment that stands out as legitimately bad.</p><p>"Joey leaving a disabled woman in the wilderness after burning her wooden leg," a fan pointed out on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a>.</p><p>Seems a bit out of character, but the bad moments are also part of who he is.</p><p>Chandler is another character that people love, but despite all of his good qualities, he showed some cruelness on the show.</p><p>"Not sure if it's the worst thing ever done by any of them, but one moment that comes to mind is when Chandler has had enough of exercising with Monica and gets her so depressed that she's sapped of all energy and takes a nap. It's an unusually cruel moment from him and honestly a fairly dark scene," another fan highlighted.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The subject of the characters and their worst moments has focused on each member of the core group, and when it comes to Monica, there is one devilish moment that stands out in the worst way possible.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This 'Friends' Guest-Star Apologized To Jennifer Aniston For His Bad Behavior On-Set</a></span></p><h2 id=monica-39-s-worst-moment-was-during-adoption>Monica's Worst Moment Was During Adoption</h2><p>So, what is the worst thing that Monica Geller did while on Friends? While there were some great picks by fans, there is one particular moment that seems to stand out for many.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Mm, yeah, trying to adopt Erica's baby (babies!) via lying about who she is...I sympathized with Monica, but it was still very selfish and honestly, I was with Erica when she called her out after they tell the truth. I am glad Chandler was able to talk some sense into Monica, and then we get one of the best Chandler scenes, imho," a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a> user wrote.</p><p>â€‹This is such a great pick, and many people are in agreeable that it's the worst thing that Monica did on the show.</p><p>As infamous as this moment is, it's not the only one that popped up multiple times during this discussion.</p><p>"Phoebe and Mike's rehearsal dinner and wedding - she was awful," another person wrote.</p><p>Again, this is a great choice, as anyone who watched that episodes could not possibly have liked the way that Monica behaved. Each character has their bad moments, but Phoebe and Mike's rehearsal and wedding was another level of bad.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Matt LeBlanc Would Prank David Schwimmer Backstage During 'Friends'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Monica Geller has so many great moments and likable qualities, but what she did while trying to adopt Erica's babies was just awful. It just goes to show that even characters we love have some serious flaws.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Was David Schwimmer's Storyline With Denise Richards His Worst Moment On Friends?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidmqajYsGptc2kZK2gmah6uK3SZqSoppmYrrR51qiprKxdoryusc2tZKimXZu%2FqrHNnapo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffans-think-this-was-monica-s-worst-moment-on-friends.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ffans-think-this-was-monica-s-worst-moment-on-friends.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ffans-think-this-was-monica-s-worst-moment-on-friends.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ffans-think-this-was-monica-s-worst-moment-on-friends.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffans-think-this-was-monica-s-worst-moment-on-friends.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffans-think-this-was-monica-s-worst-moment-on-friends.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./is-david-raccuglia-married-to-wife-or-dating-a-girlfriend.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./is-david-raccuglia-married-to-wife-or-dating-a-girlfriend.html>Is David Raccuglia Married to Wife?
