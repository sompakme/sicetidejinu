Since his rise to fame, Jay-Z has been seen flashing some pretty shiny watches while serenading fans with his thought-provoking lyrics. His love for watches is even evident in his songs and he constantly makes references to certain pieces he owns:&nbsp;"Yuh!&nbsp;100 million crib, three million watch.&nbsp;All facts."</p><p>Here are the 10 most expensive timepieces Jay-Z owns.</p><h2 id=hublot-big-bang>Hublot Big Bang</h2><p>This dazzling timepiece was given to Jay-Z as a surprise birthday gift from his wife of 11 years, singer and songwriter, Beyonce. This custom watch that the rapper received on his 43rd birthday, took over 14 months to create and contains 1282 diamonds. Also, some of the world's most highly skilled jewelers were recruited to make this piece. Reportedly, Mrs. Carter paid $5,000,000 for this one-of-a-kind watch and unfortunately, it's not on the market.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=richard-mille-rm-027>Richard Mille RM 027</h2><p>The <a href=#>hip-hop icon</a> is reportedly a huge fan of Richard Mille, so it is no surprise that he owns this luxurious watch created by the popular Swiss brand. The&nbsp;RM027 model that Jay-Z owns is actually the 50 special edition, the original was created during a collaboration with tennis superstar, Rafael Nadal.</p><p>Also known as the "Blueprint," this watch, which also took 3,000 hours to make, was priced at $800,000 when it was released, and like most of Richard Mille's pieces, it is hard to come by.</p><h2 id=shawn-carter-by-hublot>Shawn Carter By Hublot</h2><p>This Hublot piece is quite special because it's a product of a collaboration between Jay-Z and one of his other favored brands. The Shawn Carter Hublot, which as released in 2013, comes in two varieties: a black ceramic model and yellow gold.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Of The World's Rarest Watches That Cost A Fortune</a></span></p><p>There were only 250 black ceramic Hublots created, and as for the yellow gold, only 100 were released. Though this brand is limited, it can be purchased online, the black ceramic for $6,000 and the yellow gold for $15,000.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=audemars-piguet-royal-oak-offshore>Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Offshore</h2><p>Another iconic Swiss brand that has been a long-time favorite of Jay-Z's is Audemars Piguet. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rapper was honored</a> for his adoration of the brand in 2006 when AP created the Royal Oak Offshore 10th Anniversary Jay-Z edition. Only 100 timepieces were released at the time of its creation with 50 made in stainless steel, 30 created in rose gold, and 20 designed in high-end platinum. This item may be hard to obtain but the pre-owned rose gold piece can be bought at $40,000 and the platinum watch can be purchased at $55,000.</p><h2 id=rolex-perpetual-calendar-franck-muller-configuration>Rolex Perpetual Calendar – Franck Muller Configuration</h2><p>The Rolex brand is a beloved brand by many. Rolex is a well-known name when it comes to timepieces, as a matter of fact. It's no surprise that the owner of Roc-a-Fella nation would own a few models designed by <a href=#>this sought after brand</a>. Jay-Z debuted the Perpetual Calendar brand when he received the President's Merit Award at the Pre-Grammy Gala in 2018. The watch features a full calendar dial function and a self-winding movement. Unfortunately, anyone looking for this classic piece, created by watchmaker Frank Mueller, won't be able to find it as it is a rare, special edition.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rolex-president-day-date-white-roman-dial>Rolex President Day Date White Roman Dial</h2><p>Another Rolex item that Jay-Z has sported quite often is the President Day Date White Roman Dial. This President Day Date Rolex timepiece comes in yellow gold and platinum, which Jay-Z just so happens to own. Out of all the watches Mr. Carter owns, this one makes him truly feel like a "baller." It could be because of the watch's status. Plus, the Day Date watch is the most recognizable. The Rolex can be purchased for $17,790.</p><h2 id=patek-phillippe-nautilus-perpetual-calendar>Patek Phillippe Nautilus Perpetual Calendar</h2><p>This prestigious watch is a member of the Patek Phillippe brand, another high-end watch company that is a favorite of the infamous rapper. The Nautilus piece is considered to be a bit more "complicated" due it's structure. The watch shows the planisphere of the northern hemisphere and also the differens phases of the moon. This watch, which is stainless steel and white, is not as flashy as its other competitors, however it's a must own for any avid watch collector. The Nautilus Perpetual Calendar is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">currently sold out, but there is a waiting-list</a>&nbsp;you can join.</p><h2 id=jaeger-lecoultre-grande-reverso-duoface>Jaeger Lecoultre Grande Reverso Duoface</h2><p>While this watch isn't always seen on the "It's a Hard Knock Life" rappers arm, it still is a very elegant piece that steals the scene. The rose-gold, Grande Reverso Duoface, is a tribute to the 1931 original design. Whenever the multi-millionaire is spotted wearing this&nbsp; fancy piece, it's with a <a href=#>dressy black or white tuxedo</a>. If anyone with oodles of cash is interested in collecting this item, the price for it is $10,990.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rolex-cosmograph-daytona>Rolex Cosmograph Daytona</h2><p>“I don’t got the bright watch, I got the right watch.”&nbsp;This Rolex timepiece is another <a href=#>laid-back, less flashy watch</a> that can be worn for any regular occasion, but it is still another one of the most sought-after pieces. The Cosmograph Daytona is the first Rolex to sport the ceramic bezel and can be seen on Jay-Z's wrist when he's out with his wife or meeting with friends. Available either in white or black ceramic bezel, the casual watch is available for purchase for $22,900.</p><h2 id=rolex-gmt-masters-ii>Rolex GMT Masters II</h2><p>While there hasn't been a confirmation as to if Mr. Carter owns this watch, it is rumored that the Rolex GMT Masters II was given to the sound engineers that worked on the collaboration album, Watch The Throne. The album brought together the musical geniuses of the Grammy-award winning rapper and his colleague, Kanye West. Apparently, the duo gave these out as a thank you to the hard-working engineers that kept the successful album from being pirated. Perhaps the rappers kept a timepiece for themselves as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The GMT Masters watch was originally created to help aid airline pilots but now it is now is an in-demand item many world travelers are seeking to get their hands on. The watch shows two different time zones and is priced at $12,995.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>The New Apple Watch Has Serious Benefits For Your Heart</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS3osWMs2Scp5yhsqTAyKilZqyZorKxtcScnKxlla29prrSoq2eZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f10-most-expensive-timepieces-in-jay-z-s-collection.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f10-most-expensive-timepieces-in-jay-z-s-collection.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f10-most-expensive-timepieces-in-jay-z-s-collection.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f10-most-expensive-timepieces-in-jay-z-s-collection.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f10-most-expensive-timepieces-in-jay-z-s-collection.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f10-most-expensive-timepieces-in-jay-z-s-collection.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./ann-druyan-biography-age-family-education-carl-sagan-quotes-books-and-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./ann-druyan-biography-age-family-education-carl-sagan-quotes-books-and-net-worth.html>Ann Druyan Biography, Age, Family, Education, Carl Sagan, Quotes, Books And Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-are-kevin-costner-s-three-baby-mamas.html>Who Are Kevin Costner's Three Baby Mamas?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./who-are-kevin-costner-s-three-baby-mamas.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
