In <a href=#>an interview with Logo/MTV</a> she said, “The gay fans have always been very loyal, they are a really great audience and have always been there for me.” In honorary tribute to the legendary queer icon, this list celebrates Olivia's moments of pride.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Olivia Newton-John's Career Was So Much More Than Grease</a></span></p><h2 id=physical-1981><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Physical (1981)</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The 1981 pop mega-hit "Physical" by Olivia Newton-John generated controversy for its sexualized lyrics, paired with a music video ending in two men holding hands. “Physical” achieved great success worldwide, but was censored and banned from radio stations for insinuating provocative content that challenged societal norms of sexuality and orientation. “Physical” cemented Olivia’s legacy as a pop star and transformed her image in the public eye from a sweet, innocent Sandy to sexy, eccentric Olivia.</p><h2 id=xanadu-1980><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Xanadu (1980)</span></h2><p>Xanadu is a flamboyant disco, musical fantasy, and love story that flopped at the box office but has resonated with gay culture throughout the ages. The cult classic film received negative reviews and the first Golden Raspberry Awards, an annual event dishonoring the worst in cinema for a given year. The director of a stage parody of the movie titled Xanadu Live!,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Anne Dorsen, called it</a> "the queerest movie that’s not actually about being gay."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=performances-at-pride-events><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Performances At Pride Events</span></h2><p>In 2011, Olivia performed at New York City's Pride celebration after the state officiated a marriage equality bill. She also performed at Los Angeles's Pride Festival, Sydney Mardi Gras, and other pride events. She shared with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Advocate</a>, “I think love is love.

In 1974, Olivia competed with the song “Long Live Love” representing the UK and achieved fourth in the competition, won by ABBA’s performance of “Waterloo”. The international TV and radio contest has long been embraced by the gay community for celebrating queerness and encouraging everyone to be their authentic selves.</p><h2 id=the-rumor-advocates-aids-awareness><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>The Rumor Advocates AIDS Awareness</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Olivia's album The Rumor (1988) addressed AIDS and featured the first same sex song ever recorded by a mainstream artist titled, "Love and Let Live".

She received positive encouragement for the song, developed a stronger connection with the gay community, and solidified her role as a gay icon and ally.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Were Olivia Newton John's Final Days Like?</a></span></p><h2 id=it-39-s-my-party-dignifies-aids-patients><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>It's My Party Dignifies AIDS Patients</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s My Party is a film about a gay architect, with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, who hosts a dinner party that ends in him committing suicide.

In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with The Advocate</a> she said, “With respect to marriage equality, I believe that no-one has the right to judge and deny couples who love each other the ability to make a marriage commitment. Love is love.” Throughout her career spanning decades, Olivia advocated for gay rights and raised funds and awareness through charitable events, foundations, and live performances.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdpLmqwsiaZKedp6m8r3nJqJ%2BnZaeWwG6tjKqsnp2iYraku81mmKecXZa5rcWO</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-olivia-newton-john-was-a-queer-icon-and-ally.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-olivia-newton-john-was-a-queer-icon-and-ally.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-olivia-newton-john-was-a-queer-icon-and-ally.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-olivia-newton-john-was-a-queer-icon-and-ally.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-olivia-newton-john-was-a-queer-icon-and-ally.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-olivia-newton-john-was-a-queer-icon-and-ally.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./austin-butler-s-voice-coach-defends-his-ongoing-elvis-accent.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./austin-butler-s-voice-coach-defends-his-ongoing-elvis-accent.html>Austin Butlers Voice Coach Defends His Ongoing Elvis Accent</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-is-dora-dolphin-details-to-know-about-the-cast-of-a-loud-house-christmas-on-instagram.html>Who Is Dora Dolphin?
