She became what students of the Store called the Godmother of the world famous business.</p><h2 id=how-it-all-started>How It All Started</h2><p>In the 1940’s and 50’s Ciro’s was the major hangout spot for everyone from Hollywood’s elite to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">mobsters of the day</a>. It was the place to be and frequented by celebrities.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shore’s husband Sammy and comedy writer Rudy DeLuca purchased Ciro’s in 1972 out of a need for a location to work when not out on the road, but it was Shore who soon assumed nightly operations and was quickly recognized for her eye for true talent.</p><h2 id=making-it-her-own>Making It Her Own</h2><p>She came up with the name The Comedy Store and <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">comedians flocked to the already famed location</a> to test out their material before taking it on the road.</p><p>Just two years later, Shore became sole owner after she and Sammy divorced, allowing her to take the Store to levels unreached across the country.</p><p>Comedians would even work at the Store full-time and <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">earn their way </a>to being considered ‘Paid-Regulars’ on the evening shows. Those ‘paid-regulars’ earned notoriety and a historical place along the walls of The Comedy Store.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-idea-behind-the-store>The Idea Behind The Store</h2><p>For Shore, she wanted to develop an artists school of sorts, letting <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">stand-up comedians</a> develop their craft and learn from each other. A family-like environment was created, where veterans who had already earned their notoriety could shepherd the newcomers.</p><p>Up and coming stars wanted their chance to perform and eagerly took her advice and guidance to create a future in the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">craft they loved</a>. She was the one to encourage them, but also to shoot straight. It was Mitzi who told regulars like Sam Kinison they couldn’t returned until they had attended rehab.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">How Chelsea Handler Became One Of The Highest-Paid Comedians In The World</a></span></p><h2 id=a-growing-business>A Growing Business</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shore was able to purchase the building in 1976 and quickly transformed the 99-seat theater to a 450-seat main room.</p><p>As the Sunset location became enormously popular, what was once a single-stage venue held in the Original Room, became three stages; The Original Room, The Belly Room and the Main Room and additional locations opened in Westwood, Pacific Beach, La Jolla and <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Las Vegas</a>.</p><p>Today, the store in La Jolla still exists as well as the original famous location.</p><h2 id=from-store-to-home>From Store To 'Home'</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The 1970’s comedian Richard Pryor famously worked his material in front of an audience for his ‘Live From the Sunset Strip’ album night after night. Now famous comedians can say they officially got their start with their time on The Comedy Store’s stage. According to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">The Comedy Store</a> website, future stars included Robin Williams, David Letterman, Jay Leno, Garry Shandling, Andy Kaufman and Michael Keaton.</p><p>By the early 90’s, new voices landed on the stage from celebrities like Howie Mandel, Louie Anderson, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Jim Carrey</a>, Arsenio Hall and others.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Shore allowed many of these young hopeful stars to crash at her 5,000 square foot home on Cresthill Rd. near The Comedy Store and the place quickly became the spot for all-night parties, drinking and cocaine use. Some young comedians even lived in the home, including <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Full House’s Dave Coulier</a>, Jim Carrey and Bill Hicks. In 1988, Shore kicked all of them out and reestablished the house as a recovery home. for a few years, until it was eventually sold.</p><h2 id=not-always-a-good-time>Not Always a Good Time</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 1979, as the club expanded, comedians began demanding to get paid. Shore felt that she and her ‘flock’ benefited each other and while they weren’t top notch yet, they were headed toward high paying gigs. The comedians decided to picket, resulting in a strike that lasted six weeks. Mitzi eventually gave in, agreeing to pay $15 per set, but she never forgave some of the most vocal, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">banning them</a> from her Store for life.</p><p>In addition, Shore saw the untimely deaths of comedians over the years, whether from natural causes, addiction or health decline. She <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">said goodbye</a> to Freddie Prinze, Richard Pryor, Robin Williams , John Witherspoon, Bob Saget and many others.</p><h2 id=more-opportunities>More Opportunities</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shore noticed a male majority forming at the club and began creating opportunities for others to grace the stage. Upon the opening of a second stage at The Comedy Store, a 50-seat location upstairs called the Belly Room specifically catered to female comedians. Open Mic night brought the likes of <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Roseanne Barr</a> and Whoopi Goldberg to the stage. She later created evenings like Phat Tuesdays, featuring Black comedians, Latino and LGBTQ performers.</p><h2 id=mitzi-s-goodbye>Mitzi's Goodbye</h2><p>At the time of her death, Shore had a net worth of $20 million. She passed away at a West Hollywood hospice in 2018 at the age of 87 and the love famous comedians had for her became evident. <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Comedian Joe Rogan </a>had performed at The Comedy Store for free for 13 years and dedicated his comedy special Strange Times to Mitzi a few months after her death. Other celebrities thanked Shore for her impact on their lives and the life of stand-up comedy as a whole.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Comedy Store lives on, however, in the hands of one of Shore’s sons, Peter. According to the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">L.A. Times</a>, he took over as the Store’s CEO 20 years ago, when Mitzi began showing signs of Parkinson’s disease. He’s not the one scouting talent – that job was always his mother’s, but has continued the tradition of making The Comedy Store home to up and coming comedians.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Netflix, Comedy Central, And How Dave Chappelle Changed The Game</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">The Comedy Store</a>, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">L.A.
