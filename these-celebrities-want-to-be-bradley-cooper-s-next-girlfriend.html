I mean, we made a love story. For me, as a performer and as an actress, of course, we wanted people to believe that we were in love." But, seriously, there's also no denying that she waxes poetic about him and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">love experts seem to think she was into him</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=selena-gomez><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Selena Gomez</span></h2><p>During an interview for her 2013 album, "Stars Dance", <a href=#>Selena Gomez</a> has asked about meeting Bradley Cooper.
