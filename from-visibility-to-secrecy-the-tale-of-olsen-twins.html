So what happened to Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Olsen twins became famous from their very childhood, and they are still well-known today. <a href=#>They've been working throughout their whole life</a>, and whatever they've been doing - it's been going great. The fraternal twins started their paths from acting, which eventually led to creating a multi-billion empire. Do you know that they were <a href=#>the youngest producers in Hollywood</a>? They owned a multi-media production company at the age of six! Today, they own two luxury clothing brands and work on them every day. But, curiously, they are among the celebrities that don't have any social media presence. Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen created a self-branded empire that allows them to be visible without social media.</p><h2 id=the-beginning-of-the-journey>The Beginning Of The Journey</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Olsen twins&nbsp;were playing Michelle Tanner on the <a href=#>TV series </a>Full House, which brought the duo to the path of glory. The two played one role, as the child labor laws required infants to work no more than 20 minutes per episode, so the girls switched each other between takes. Interestingly, they accidentally got this role - <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their mother sent their picture to a casting agency</a>, and they successfully passed the audition.</p><p>The Olsen twins were only nine months old when they started working, and, unsurprisingly, it wasn't easy. During filming, they were crying a lot, which <a href=#>made the crew recast them</a>. But, as the twins turned out irreplaceable, they were soon rehired. Later on, in the <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Marie Claire</a> 2010 interview, Mary-Kate shared her thoughts, stating that she'd never wish her upbringing to anyone. Also, she said there's no connection to the photos from that time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Mary-Kate & Ashley Olsen Built Their Financial Empire</a></span></p><h2 id=acing-their-prosperous-careers>Acing Their Prosperous Careers</h2><p>Although the behind-the-scene stuff was challenging, the Olsen sisters 'stole the show'. Indeed, the world could see the cute sisters growing up within seven years, their first steps, first words, and first jokes. Once the TV show ended, a new page in their famous life opened. Mary-Kate and Ashley became the owners of a <a href=#>media company</a>, Dualstar Entertainment Group. It's a considerable lifestyle retailer that helped the girls create their brand and brought them even more fame. They produced various merchandise: TV shows, books, movies, video games, a magazine, even furniture, bath products, and many more. It's hard to count the number of films and shows the Olsen twins were starring in, but they <a href=#>became millionaires</a> at the age of 10.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Consequently, the girls earned a solid fan group among the 'tweens' demographic - those aged 5-12 years old. "We didn't have to dig too deep. We were playing cutesy little twins who solved mysteries. There was no depth to any of the characters. It was somebody else's idea of ourselves. It was very much people-pleasing as opposed to actually, I guess, working for it," said Mary-Kate to W magazine.</p><p>Yet, even this flourishing period had its end - the Olsen twins' final film was released in 2004. Mary-Kate continued acting solo - she was filmed in Weeds (2007) and Beastly (2011). As for Ashley, she was done with acting,&nbsp;"I don't like to be the center of attention anymore," she said in one of the interviews. Even in 2016, when Netflix aired a reunion show, Fuller House, the whole cast returned except for the Olsen twins. They <a href=#>claimed to have no idea of the spinoff.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=foraying-into-other-ventures>Foraying Into Other Ventures</h2><p>So, the Olsen twins finished with acting but not with working. Instead, they changed their focus into the fashion industry and started two fashion lines, <a href=#>The Row (2006)</a> and Elizabeth and James (2007). Indeed, they have unique relationships with the fashion industry. The Olsen twins are <a href=#>fashion icons</a> since the 90s and 2000s - there are even fan <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram accounts</a> that praise their sense of style. In 2009, Ashley said to The New Your Times, "I think you're either born with a sense of style or you're not. Either you care or you don't. And we love fashion. When we were going to NYU, I think that was the first time we were aware of the power of our personal style. Not the power of it, but the result of it. Between the big sunglasses and the Starbucks cup and the big sweaters, the hobo-chic thing, we were more shocked than anything."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite them being the <a href=#>trend-setters</a>, the Olsens avoid publicity. They&nbsp;have no social media accounts, and they prefer&nbsp;offline shopping. The twins don't deny that being in the public eye was tiring, and they no longer need public approval. <a href=#>In the 2011 interview with Vogue</a>, Ashley explained that having <a href=#>social media accounts</a> "would go against everything we've done in our lives to not be in the public." So, the Olsen twins took their first selfie in 2016. Well,&nbsp;knowing how hard they've been working and what they've earned, one selfie, in their case, is totally fine.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>The Rise Of Netflix: How A DVD Rental Company Revolutionized Entertainment</a></span></p><p>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">i-D</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vogue</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WWD</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSzs7vMZq2iq5mXtq2107JkraddqLKkvsScsGasmJp6ta3LnmSonl2kubSxzWarsKGeqHw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ffrom-visibility-to-secrecy-the-tale-of-olsen-twins.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ffrom-visibility-to-secrecy-the-tale-of-olsen-twins.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ffrom-visibility-to-secrecy-the-tale-of-olsen-twins.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ffrom-visibility-to-secrecy-the-tale-of-olsen-twins.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ffrom-visibility-to-secrecy-the-tale-of-olsen-twins.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ffrom-visibility-to-secrecy-the-tale-of-olsen-twins.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./joe-pesci-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-girlfriend-family-more.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./joe-pesci-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-girlfriend-family-more.html>Joe Pesci Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./eija-skarsg%C3%A5rd-bio-wiki-age-height-family-husband-and-net-worth.html>Eija Skarsgrd Bio, Wiki, Age, Height, Family, Husband and Net Worth.</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./eija-skarsg%C3%A5rd-bio-wiki-age-height-family-husband-and-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
