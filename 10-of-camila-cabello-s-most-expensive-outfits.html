Instead, she layered them up. She wore a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$2,100 dress from Fannie Schiavoni</a>&nbsp;over a&nbsp;Saint Laurent jumpsuit covered in Swaorovski crystals &nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">worth over $2,300</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She performed the song&nbsp;Never Be the Same, the second single from her debut album, in January of 2018, shortly before the release of her album,&nbsp;Camila. This performance of an selection from her debut album had some serious visuals with the screens in the background and her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">expensive</a>, glittery ensemble only intensified that.</p><h2 id=jingle-ball-ruffles>Jingle Ball Ruffles</h2><p>This&nbsp;ruffled mini dress that Camila wore to the 2019 Jingle Ball has a price tag of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">over $3,000</a>. The dress is from Raisa Vanessa and is from the designer's Spring/Summer 2020 collection. Being a celebrity definitely has its perks, especially when it comes to clothing because Raisa Vanessa's website states that SS20 collection items won't even be shipped to buyers until March of 2020.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Celebrities Who Throw Themselves The Most Extravagant Birthday Parties</a></span></p><p>Even though Camila's outfit was as white and snowy as the weather outside, Camila definitely wasn't looking chilly in this one-shoulder dress. She also performed a few of her songs that night and opened up about songs from her new album,&nbsp;Romance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=feeling-blue>Feeling Blue</h2><p>At the MTV VMAs in 2018, Camila walked home with two awards for Artist of the Year and Video of the Year for her song&nbsp;Havana. To accept those awards, Camila wore a gown from designer Oscar de la Renta that cost&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">almost $7,000</a>.</p><p>Even though Camila was wearing a blue designer gown, we doubt she was&nbsp;really feeling all that blue about the evening's events. Along with winning two huge awards at the show that evening, Camila had been nominated for a number more of them. But,&nbsp;Havana missed out on Song of the Year, an award that went to Post Malone for his song&nbsp;Rockstar.</p><h2 id=mixed-prints>Mixed Prints</h2><p>This dress features an all-over animal print with some gold design details. It's from Versace and Camila wore it for a photoshoot.

The fact that it's a designer gown and is made in Italy with such luxurious material definitely explains the pricetag that it has attached to it. It's obvious that whether it's at a red carpet or in a photoshoot, Camila always has to have the finest pieces of clothing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=her-havana-video-look>Her Havana Video Look</h2><p>In her Havana video, Camila channeled a telenovela star in a yellow dress and huge earrings. The dress cost&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$1,290</a>&nbsp;while those big earrings from Alessandra Rich cost&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$480</a>.</p><p>This wasn't the only outfit that Camila rocked in the&nbsp;Havana video, but it definitely is one of the more expensive ones. Along with playing the role of a massive telenovela star <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in a fictional TV show</a>, Camila also played the role of a young woman with a seriously quirky family who heads out for a night on the town.</p><h2 id=red-carpet-tulle>Red Carpet Tulle</h2><p>At the American Music Awards, Camila rocked a long braid in her hair and a beige, tulle dress from Oscar de la Renta.

This dress, which is so new that it's not even being shipped to non-A list buyers just yet, and her dress at the VMAs were both by the designer. Other stars that have worn Oscar de la Renta gowns include Taylor Swift, Jessica Alba, and Kerry Washington.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=candid-but-not-casual>Candid But Not Casual</h2><p>When she was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">leaving Capital London</a> after doing an interview on the air that morning, Camila looked totally flawless in head-to-toe Valentino.

A few days before the event,&nbsp;she even posted a picture with Shawn Mendes and teased that the two of them were working together. Was it a clue that Se√±orita&nbsp;was coming?</p><h2 id=her-skechers-campaign>Her Skechers Campaign</h2><p>Even though the sneakers that Camila wore for this Skechers campaign were only around $50, the dress she was wearing was definitely&nbsp;a lot more expensive.
