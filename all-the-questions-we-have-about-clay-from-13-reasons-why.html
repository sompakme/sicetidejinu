But that being said, we completely separate the actor from the character he plays here. According to public interviews and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his social media pages</a>,&nbsp;Dylan Minnette&nbsp;is a great guy with a great heart. Any girl would be lucky to date him and any guy would be lucky to be his friend... but let's talk about the character of Clay Jensen he plays on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">13 Reasons Why</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Clay Jensen most definitely has good intentions, but he occasionally exhibits signs of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">toxic masculinity</a> and entitlement. He also makes some questionable choices and between season one and season three of 13 Reasons Why, we have 13 questions we'd like to ask.</p><h2 id=why-didn-t-clay-report-tyler-down-for-almost-shooting-up-a-school-dance><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Why Didn't Clay Report Tyler Down For Almost Shooting Up A School Dance?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/13reasons-1.jpg><p>Tyler Down showed up to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the high school dance</a> with a bag full of weapons and what did Clay Jensen do?

Clay Jensen on the other hand? It took him an entire season to listen to all of the tapes. Obviously, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">show creators from Netflix</a> decided to split up the tapes into separate episodes to create the proper setup of the story, so we do understand why it worked out the way it did.</p><h2 id=why-did-clay-judge-hannah-baker-for-sleeping-with-zach><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Why Did Clay Judge Hannah Baker For Sleeping With Zach?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/hannah.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Clay Jensen put Hannah Baker on such an unrealistically high pedestal as if she was meant to be some untouched and undefiled flower. Clay judged her beyond words after finding out that she swiped her V-card with Zach. In reality, it was&nbsp;just fine for Hannah Baker to hook up with Zach. She and Zach connected, Zach was always respectful of her, and her choice to become sexually active should not have warranted judgment– from anyone.</p><h2 id=why-did-clay-try-victim-blaming-shaming-in-regards-to-the-clubhouse><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Why Did Clay Try Victim Blaming/Shaming In Regards To The Clubhouse?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/13reasons.png><p>After seeing photos of girls being taken advantage of in the clubhouse controlled by the football players, Clay Jensen had the audacity to ask why girls get themselves into these types of predicaments. Sheri shut him down real quick when she said, "Clay, you don't know what was happening in this photo and you don't know what happened after. Girls don't get themselves into bad situations. Guys make the situations bad. You don't know what that feels like, to be a girl in that room."

He needs the help of a therapist right away after everything he has been through. He went through grief and mourning after losing Hannah, the end of his relationship with Skye, the rejection of Ani, the process of listening to those tapes, the process of trying to take Bryce down in court, and worst of all... the feeling of guilt weighing on his shoulders for Hannah's death.</p><h2 id=why-did-clay-try-to-make-hannah-into-someone-she-s-not><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Why Did Clay Try To Make Hannah Into Someone She's Not?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/hannah-clay.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is one of the biggest questions we have.

The way it all perfectly wrapped up worked out in Alex Standall's favor because Alex is actually the one who killed him. Our question is, why did Clay go along with that when he is always so uppity about truth, honesty, integrity, etc. Sometimes he cares about being noble, moralistic, and upright... and other times he doesn't?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">13 Reasons Why: Ranking The Most Intense Moments From Season 1 To 3</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiapZmpYn50edGemKynnqh6uLTYZqiunaOptrC60mg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fall-the-questions-we-have-about-clay-from-13-reasons-why.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fall-the-questions-we-have-about-clay-from-13-reasons-why.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fall-the-questions-we-have-about-clay-from-13-reasons-why.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fall-the-questions-we-have-about-clay-from-13-reasons-why.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fall-the-questions-we-have-about-clay-from-13-reasons-why.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fall-the-questions-we-have-about-clay-from-13-reasons-why.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./channel-margot-robbie-s-barbiecore-style-with-this-pink-purse.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./channel-margot-robbie-s-barbiecore-style-with-this-pink-purse.html>Channel Margot Robbie's Barbiecore Style With This Pink Purse</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./unboxing-twitch-titan-kai-cenat-s-net-worth.html>Unboxing Twitch Titan Kai Cenat's Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./unboxing-twitch-titan-kai-cenat-s-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
