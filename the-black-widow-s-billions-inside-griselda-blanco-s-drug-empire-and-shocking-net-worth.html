The drug mistress earned the nickname "The Black Widow" because three of her four husbands ended up dead.</p><p>She rose to fame and power in the 1980s, <a href=#>running cocaine for the Medellín Cartel</a> and designing special undergarments that would help cartel members smuggle cocaine across the border to other South and North American countries.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Griselda worked closely with Colombian drug kingpin Pablo Escobar, who was a friend from childhood.</p><p>Blanco's notoriety precedes her; she was one of the most murderous crime bosses of all time and was allegedly responsible for at least 200 murders of men, women, and children.</p><p>At her peak, <a href=#>Griselda Blanco had a net worth of $2 billion</a>.</p><p>She was believed to have owned over $500 million worth of real estate, a portion of which, totaling $120 million, fell under the discerning scrutiny of American authorities and was subsequently seized.</p><p>Her story is the subject of the new six-part biographical crime drama starring Sofía Vergara and created by Narcos and Narcos: Mexico showrunner Eric Newman.</p><p><strong>Updated, March 2024:</strong> On March 1st, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">InSight Crime published an analysis</a> of Netflix's Griselda, pointing out what the documentary "got wrong" about Griselda Blanco in its dramatized narrative. Positing that the fictionalized version of Blanco's life "softened" her image and motivations, the outlet said:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"The series attempts to portray Blanco as a mother who had no other choice than to get into the drug trade to provide for her sons after running away to Miami to escape her husband ...</p><p>" ... In reality, Blanco became a well-known figure for her use of violence. She was known to be ruthless with her enemies, and even pioneered the modus operandi of sicariato, or assassins-for-hire, which has become common in every country in Latin America.</p><p>"The use of violence by female criminal leaders, which is varied and complex, is regularly overlooked by researchers, security forces, and prosecutors. Violent women, especially those associated with organized crime, are treated as outliers because they defy the gender stereotype of women as natural caregivers rather than perpetrators of violence."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:25</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/griselda-blanco-net-worth-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Griselda And Pablo Escobar Are On The List</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>From Cartels To Cash: The Richest Drug Dealers Of All Time</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Interest in the world’s wealthiest drug lords spiked due to Netflix’s Griselda, as well as a new docudrama about Pablo Escobar’s hippo, Pepe.</span><h2 id=griselda-blanco-39-s-early-life>Griselda Blanco's Early Life</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/griselda-blanco.jpg><p>Born in 1943 in the bustling port city of Cartagena, Colombia, Griselda Blanco's early life was far from easy.</p><p>Blanco and her mother, Ana, moved to Medellín when she was three years old, and this exposed her to a criminal lifestyle at an early age.</p><p>Poverty clung to her like a second skin in the crime-filled streets of Medellín.</p><p>She reportedly committed her first murder at the age of 11, when she shot a boy who came from a wealthy neighborhood after his family refused to pay a ransom.</p><p>She also became a skilled pickpocket and thief, and fled from her abusive mother's boyfriend at the age of 19.</p><p>She survived on the streets of Medellín by stealing and possibly by engaging in sex work, although she later denied the latter allegation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Blanco's introduction to drugs came when she met her second husband, a trafficker named Alberto Bravo, who was involved in the marijuana trade outside of Columbia.</p><p>Together, they started a drug business that would eventually lead them to the United States and the lucrative cocaine market.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/sackler-bankruptcy.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>More On Cartels</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Sackler Saga: Purdue Pharma, Opioids, And The $6 Billion Dilemma</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Can a $6 billion bankruptcy settlement cleanse Purdue Pharma and the Sacklers of their transgressions and give them a clean slate?</span><h2 id=griselda-and-the-drug-trade>Griselda And The Drug Trade</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/griselda-blanco-money.jpg><p>Griselda Blanco was one of the most influential and notorious drug lords in the history of Colombia and the United States.</p><p>She started her drug career in Colombia with her first husband, Carlos Trujillo, who dealt marijuana.
