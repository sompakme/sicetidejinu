This includes Brighton Sharbino who portrayed young Lizzie Samuels at one point. Sharbino’s Lizzie may have only appeared for several episodes, but the character has certainly left quite an impression, <a href=#>killing her own sister</a> before <a href=#>being told to look at the flowers during her own execution</a>. Today, Sharbino is all grown up, taking on a wide range of projects that clearly show she can do more than horror.</p><h2 id=the-walking-dead-opened-a-lot-of-opportunities-for-brighton>The Walking Dead Opened A Lot Of Opportunities For Brighton</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When The Walking Dead cast Sharbino, she was relatively new in Hollywood, having made brief appearances in shows such as Friday Night Lights, Hannah Montana, and Barney & Friends. And so, the AMC series was one of her first steadier gigs and Sharbino was more than happy to surrounded by industry veterans. “I learned a lot just being on the set and working amongst really great professional actors and actresses,” the actress told CrypticRock.com. “I learned that you really have to work on your craft to be any good at it; the best thing to do is constantly working and better yourself.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Is Alexa Nisenson From 'Fear The Walking Dead' Up To Now?</a></span></p><p>Around the same time that she was starring in the series, Sharbino started getting some acting gigs here and there. For instance, she made guest appearances in hit series like NCIS, Once Upon a Time, and True Detective. And when she left the AMC series, Sharbino also found more casting opportunities here way. “The Walking Dead definitely opened up a lot of opportunities for me. I am so grateful for my time on the show because I have had a lot more opportunities over the past few years,” the actress said. “I have been working on some really cool projects and I’m excited!”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-went-on-to-play-jennifer-garner-s-daughter>She Went On To Play Jennifer Garner’s Daughter</h2><p>Miracles from Heaven was one of the first projects that Sharbino worked on after exiting The Walking Dead. Based on a true story, Sharbino played Abby Beam, the sister of a young girl (played by Kylie Rogers) who suffered from a rare and incurable disease. Meanwhile, the girls’ mother was played by none other than Golden Globe-winning actress Jennifer Garner. They were also joined by Queen Latifah and Martin Henderson who played the family patriarch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of working with Garner, Sharbino has said that the veteran actress is “the sweetest person ever.” In fact, Garner even sent her younger co-star an unexpected present. “She overheard me talking with my friend about how I've always wanted a typewriter and she sent one to my house,” Sharbino revealed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">while speaking with Brat TV</a>. “I don't know how she got my address, but it was a delightful surprise.”</p><h2 id=brighton-starred-in-several-other-films>Brighton Starred In Several Other Films</h2><p>Sharbino’s next project involved the comedy-drama Bitch alongside Jason Ritter, Jaime King, and Marianna Palka who also wrote and directed the movie. Around the same time, Sharbino also played one of the lead characters in the holiday film The Christmas Trap (a.k.a. Christmas in the Heartland). As Sharbino’s co-star, Bryan Whorton, had explained, “Basically, two girls meet on a plane, and they end up switching places.” As for his own role, Whorton told My Devotional Thoughts that he played Sharbino’s “crazy uncle.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#> 10 Things Walking Dead Creator Robert Kirkman Has Said About His Hit Show</a></span></p><p>Soon enough, Sharbino was also cast to play lead in the comedy drama Urban Country. In the movie, Sharbino played Faith, a troubled young woman who has to choose between living in the city or the country. According to Gianna Montelaro, who&nbsp;wrote the movie, Urban Country is “inspired by growth,” specifically Faith’s. “To see a young girl overcome bad circumstances and make plans for a bigger and better life for herself by any means necessary,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Montelaro told We Are Moving Stories</a>. “This film is also about forgiveness, forgiving others and forgiving yourself.”</p><h2 id=she-s-also-made-a-return-to-television>She’s Also Made A Return To Television</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the past, Sharbino joined the cast of the family drama series Zoe Valentine. Almost soon after, she joined the cast of the Snap Original series Players. For Sharbino, it didn’t take long for her to realize that it was the perfect project for her. “It caught my eye because it was one of the scripts I read the fastest out of everything. I've never read a script that quick!” the actress told Girl’s Life. “It was really entertaining for me, so that was one thing I thought was very special. And then, when we get into the logistics of it, even the way it was shot was really special because we shot it all vertically for Snapchat!”</p><p>Around the time that Sharbino was starring in the series, the actress also found time to work on the action film Beckman. In the film, she was joined by Burt Young, William Baldwin, and David A.R.
