His wife Queen Carolina is played by the Supernatural star, actress Darla Taylor.</p><p>Josh Ramsay meets the ex-King of Toyland upon his waking up in a strange land in front of a toy factory. The King tells Josh that he was overthrown by his wife Queen Carolina, after seducing him into a feeling of safety.</p><p>She then stole the heart of his daughter, Princess Porcelain (played by Canadian actress Olivia Ryan-Stern),&nbsp;which caused the king so much pain that he let Carolina take the throne. Carolina locks Porcelain’s heart in a box atop a tower, which also holds various things she has also stolen; including Josh’s way home.</p><p>Queen Carolina proceeded to steal the inhabitants’ hearts, and build her army of heartless toy soldiers.

Josh and Porcelain then proceed to find the stuttering wise man, the one with the other half of the key.</p><p>Once they find the Stuttering Wise Man they discover that he is the brother of the Outcast King, and one of the few remaining inhabitants to have a heart. He explains that Porcelain showed up at the castle as a lost child and was adopted by the king. She is also from Josh’s homeland.</p><p>The Stuttering Wise Man then leads the two into the factory that creates the heartless toy soldiers. The trio then pleads with the heartless soldiers to work together and overthrow the Queen. They soon convince the soldiers to go along with their plan.</p><p>The Outcast King charges into battle with the rebel soldiers, outnumbered, as Porcelain, the Stuttering Wise Man, and Josh go up to the tower where the box is held.</p><p>The Queen sees Josh and tries to brutally attack him. Porcelain and the Prince then open the box as the Queen attempts to steal Josh’s heart. After a flash of light, Josh regains consciousness and hears joyful cheers from the courtyard below, and finds that they have defeated the Queen.</p><p>However, the Stuttering Prince is dead as the other half of the key had been his own heart. Porcelain throws Carolina off the tower to be swarmed by angry toy soldiers. The King retakes the throne and Porcelain and Josh go home, but find that after the adventure, it didn’t feel like home, so the two return to the kingdom and live happily ever after.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=darla-taylor-supernatural></span><span>Darla Taylor Supernatural</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Taylor is a recurring actress in the TV series&nbsp;<i>Supernatural</i>.
