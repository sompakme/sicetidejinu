The next morning, I woke up with a black eye. I knew I got it from Jen, I didn’t know how,” Heather, 49, admitted during part 3 of the RHOSLC season 4 reunion on Tuesday, January 23. “But I knew I had gotten it from Jen. She was the first person I texted. She came in the room, she said, ‘Did I give that to you?’ I said, ‘Don’t worry, I’ll cover.’”</p><p>Heather admitted that she was “scared” of Jen, 50 — who is <a href=#>currently serving prison time</a> for fraud — so didn’t tell the truth. “I’d been covering for her for three years. I was not going to stop at the black eye,” Heather added.</p><p>Heather’s mysterious black eye was one of the biggest RHOSLC story lines in season 3, which aired in 2022 and early 2023. As the story went, Heather woke up during a full cast trip in San Diego <a href=#>with a black eye</a> and no recollection of what happened. Fans, and the other RHOSLC stars, were quick to speculate that Heather had been covering for Jen.</p><p>During Tuesday’s reunion, <strong>Andy Cohen</strong> revealed that Bravo did have never-before-seen footage of the morning in San Diego when Heather woke up with the injury.</p><p>“Security footage from Heather’s room was reviewed immediately,” an onscreen caption read. “The audio was unintelligible. At the time, Jen and Heather both said they were discussing a different topic. Heather now claims this footage shows them discussing the black eye.”</p><p>As the grainy footage played, Heather doubled down on her previous statements about the conversation — that Jen asked whether she was responsible for the black eye and Heather would cover for her. One major question is still unanswered: What actually caused the black eye?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Heather-Gay-Sort-Of-Reveals-How-Jen-Shah-Gave-Her-the-Infamous-%E2%80%98RHOSLC-Season-3-Black-Eye2.jpg><p>Heather subsequently apologized to Andy, her costars and Bravo viewers for lying.</p><p>“I’m sorry to you, I’m sorry to you guys, I’m sorry to the network, I’m sorry to the audience,” she said. “I didn’t know how to navigate it myself. I knew that it was becoming bigger and more than I could handle. It was a horrible situation.”</p><p>Heather first confirmed that Jen had given <a href=#>her the black eye</a> during the RHOSLC season 4 finale, which aired earlier this month.</p><p>“I ate s–t every day for her,” Heather said about Jen during the January 2 episode. “I felt like I had to lie to protect her. I did whatever it took. I went on a book tour and defended her and took s–t for the fact that she gave me a black eye.”</p><p>Jen has c<a href=#>ontinued to deny</a> giving Heather the black eye — even from prison.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“BRAVO, if I punched Heather in her eye, you guys would have footage to prove it,” her Instagram Story read on January 2. “Andy is still butt hurt that I turned down his [one-on-one] interview. Why would you sit down with someone who ‘gave’ another cast member a black eye?”</p><p>Andy, 55, denied her claims during his Radio Andy show the following day.</p><p>“I don’t wanna be Captain Obvious here, but if we had footage, don’t you think we would’ve aired it?” he said. “[We would’ve had] Heather saying, ‘I don’t know how I got the black eye,’ and then don’t you think we would’ve cut to the footage with a chyron that said ‘four hours earlier?’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKmhp6OhsLR5x56YraCVp3qordhmqZ6ulZa5tHnHqK5mopWjerS0wKFkoJmmmnqpsdFmmaWZk6B6psXEaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frhoslc-s-heather-gay-reveals-how-jen-shah-gave-her-black-eye.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2frhoslc-s-heather-gay-reveals-how-jen-shah-gave-her-black-eye.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2frhoslc-s-heather-gay-reveals-how-jen-shah-gave-her-black-eye.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2frhoslc-s-heather-gay-reveals-how-jen-shah-gave-her-black-eye.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frhoslc-s-heather-gay-reveals-how-jen-shah-gave-her-black-eye.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2frhoslc-s-heather-gay-reveals-how-jen-shah-gave-her-black-eye.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./see-nina-dobrev-and-shaun-white-s-best-style-moments.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./see-nina-dobrev-and-shaun-white-s-best-style-moments.html>See Nina Dobrev and Shaun White's Best Style Moments</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./mariah-carey-has-been-friends-with-jay-z-for-over-two-decades-but-are-they-still-close.html>Mariah Carey Has Been Friends With Jay Z For Over Two Decades, But Are They Still Close?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./mariah-carey-has-been-friends-with-jay-z-for-over-two-decades-but-are-they-still-close.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
