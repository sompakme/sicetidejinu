Weston also had an appearance in Cage's movie, Lord of War. He played a helicopter mechanic.</p><p>Weston didn't pursue acting but he still followed in the Oscar-winning actor's footsteps... at least in terms of marriage.

Cage met Kim in 2004 when she was only 19 years old. She was working as a waitress at Kabuki restaurant in Los Angeles. Before falling off the radar to live a private life, she had some acting stints in the movies Next, Werewolf When of the S.S., and Grindhouse.

She was allegedly abusive towards him and his family.

Fulton's lawyer said there was "an extensive amount of evidence to refute all the outrageous unfounded accusations." The former actress added that she was "hurt and shocked" because she's always "championed" his son who she claims to have "an ongoing issue with mental illness, substance, and alcohol abuse."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/nic-cage-in-captain-corelli-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Nicolas Cage And Penélope Cruz Had Completely Opposite Experiences Filming Captain Corelli's Mandolin</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Nicola Cage's divorce made for a terrible time on set while making a box office bomb.</span><p>Meanwhile, Cage appears to have a "normal" father-son relationship with his youngest son, Kal-El. The actor has remained good friends with his ex-wife over the years, so they've maintained a healthy co-parenting relationship. They've been spotted shopping and having dinner together with their son several times.</p><p>Kim was also reportedly present at Cage's 2021 wedding to Shibata.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I don't really count those two marriages, I don't think they belong on my record," said the actor of his previous marriages before starting his family with Kim—including <a href=# rel=nofollow>his marriage to Lisa Marie Presley</a>.</p><p>"The real marriage for me was the 14 years I had with Alice and the child we have together.''</p><p>While Nicolas may have two sons, he also has a new daughter. In 2022, Nicolas Cage welcomed his first daughter—named August—with his wife Riko Shibata. Nic announced his baby daughter's impending arrival on The Kelly Clarkson Show, saying "I'm gonna announce some big news for everyone.

I miss singing lullabies and rocking in the rocking chair."</p><p>There's no word yet, however, on whether Nicolas plans to have more children, whether with his current wife or a future one.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGilopufoa60ecKanp5lopq5osDIqKWsoJmleri106FkrKeeqHq4sdKtpqdlm5a5priMnKapqJ%2Bhrm6vwKCcaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-nicolas-cage-close-to-his-sons-weston-and-kal-el.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fis-nicolas-cage-close-to-his-sons-weston-and-kal-el.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fis-nicolas-cage-close-to-his-sons-weston-and-kal-el.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fis-nicolas-cage-close-to-his-sons-weston-and-kal-el.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-nicolas-cage-close-to-his-sons-weston-and-kal-el.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-nicolas-cage-close-to-his-sons-weston-and-kal-el.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./robert-fuller-net-worth-how-much-is-fuller-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./robert-fuller-net-worth-how-much-is-fuller-worth.html>Robert Fuller Net Worth How Much is Fuller Worth?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./girls5eva-cast-net-worth-richest-cast-members-salary.html>Girls5eva Cast Net Worth Richest Cast Members Salary</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./girls5eva-cast-net-worth-richest-cast-members-salary.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
