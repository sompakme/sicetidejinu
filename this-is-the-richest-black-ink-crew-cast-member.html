Season 9 of the popular reality TV series premiered in April last year, with ten initial episodes running till June.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another 12 episodes of the same season were broadcast from February to May 2022. The success of Black Ink Crew has brought about the advent of a spin-off series, titled Black Ink Crew: Chicago, which so far consists of seven seasons and 100 episodes.</p><p>The original show is set in Harlem, New York City and has seen dozens of cast members in its 174-episode history so far. But who among these stars is the richest of them all?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Just How Rich Is The Cast of 'Black Ink Crew Chicago'?</a></span></p><h2 id=puma-robinson---150-000><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Puma Robinson - $150,000</span></h2><p>Puma Robinson has featured in all but one of the Black Ink Crew seasons so far. He missed out on Season 5 of the show, after having been a core part of the main cast for the first four seasons. He returned in Season 6 as a guest star, and later in a supporting role in Season 7.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Robinson was fully reinstated to main cast status in the two most recent seasons of the show. His total estate is worth an estimated $150,000.</p><h2 id=o-rsquo-shit-ldquo-richard-rdquo-duncan---350-000><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>O’Shit “Richard” Duncan - $350,000</span></h2><p>O’Shit Duncan started off as a starring cast member in the first five seasons of Black Ink Crew. He played a more supporting role in Seasons 6 and 7, before being demoted even further into a guest role in the two most recent seasons of the show.</p><p>His name is normally censored as “Richard” Duncan on the series. Originally hailing from South Carolina, the 37-year-old’s net worth is rumored to stand at around the $350,000 mark.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sky-days---500-000><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Sky Days - $500,000</span></h2><p>Sky Days started out her time on Black Ink Crew as a guest cast member in the first season of the show, back in 2013. From the second season onwards, though, she was promoted to a regular, replacing Alex Estevez who was fired from the show.</p><p>According to multiple outlets online, Days is said to be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">worth around $500,000</a> today.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Stars Of ‘Black Ink Crew’: Who Is Still On The Show And Who Has Left The Tattoo Shop Behind?</a></span></p><h2 id=dutchess-lattimore---800-000><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Dutchess Lattimore - $800,000</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dutchess Lattimore has not been on Black Ink Crew in the last four seasons, but she was a starring cast member in the first five seasons of the show. Unfortunately she had to deal with incidents of racism and a spell of depression following her exit, but she did manage to bounce back.</p><p>Lattimore is now the proud owner of a tattoo shop in Charlotte, North Carolina, and is also a radio host. She is estimated to have a net worth of about $800,000.</p><h2 id=donna-lombardi---1-million><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Donna Lombardi - $1 Million</span></h2><p>Donna Lombardi joined Black Ink Crew in Season 3, originally as a supporting cast member. She was then promoted to become one of the stars of the show from the following season onwards.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lombardi was in a relationship with Alex Robinson from the show, and they even got engaged in 2019. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">They have since split up</a>, however. The 29-year-old has a net worth of $1 million.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>'Black Ink Crew: Chicago': Are Phor And Don Real Brothers?</a></span></p><h2 id=sassy-bermudez---1-million><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Sassy Bermudez - $1 Million</span></h2><p>Like Donna Lombardi, Seasons 1, 2 and 3 star Sassy Bermudez is also worth $1 million. After spending those initial years on the show as one of the main cast members, the New York City native left the show, reportedly as a consequence of false information peddled by Dutchess Lattimore about her.</p><p>Bermudez did not entirely cut ties with the show, however, and has been back in both supporting and guest roles over the years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ceasar-emanuel---2-5-million><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Ceasar Emanuel - $2.5 Million</span></h2><p>Ceasar Emanuel is the de facto king of Black Ink Crew, and the one cast member who has been a regular in every single season of the show so far. He was famously in an on-and-off relationship with Dutchess Lattimore, until they permanently called it quits.</p><p>Unfortunately for Emanuel, his spell on the show appears to have come to an end, if indeed there will be a Season 10. After a video of him <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hitting his dog</a> went viral, he was fired by VH1. He at least has a $2.5 million net worth to console him.</p><h2 id=teddy-ruks---4-million><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Teddy Ruks - $4 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Teddy Ruks is not just a tattoo artist and entrepreneur, he is also a rapper and an actor. It is no wonder, then, that he stands head and shoulders above all his Black Ink Crew cast members as the richest, with a net worth of around $4 million.</p><p>Ruks was a supporting cast member on the show in the first three seasons, but has been starring in each of those that followed after that. He got to showcase his acting skills in the movie True to the Game 2 in 2020.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>15 Things That Actually Happened On The Set Of TLC's LA Ink</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroaGjYra0edOhnGaqmZi1pr%2FTZpmlmZOgeqq6ymaaq52nYrCiv9NmpJ6lkpq%2FbrrErWSwp6KptW6vxJqqnqpdmrqiutSeo2g%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthis-is-the-richest-black-ink-crew-cast-member.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthis-is-the-richest-black-ink-crew-cast-member.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthis-is-the-richest-black-ink-crew-cast-member.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthis-is-the-richest-black-ink-crew-cast-member.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthis-is-the-richest-black-ink-crew-cast-member.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthis-is-the-richest-black-ink-crew-cast-member.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-are-kevin-costner-s-three-baby-mamas.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-are-kevin-costner-s-three-baby-mamas.html>Who Are Kevin Costner's Three Baby Mamas?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./the-truth-about-sex-education-s-mimi-keene-and-her-net-worth.html>The Truth About 'Sex Education's Mimi Keene And Her Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./the-truth-about-sex-education-s-mimi-keene-and-her-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
