Among the films, included one of the most significant of his career, The Sixth Sense. The film changed his career and bank account, as <a href=#>he pocketed $100 million for the role thanks to backend profits.</a></p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Bruce Willis' Team Told Him To Pass On A Script That Won Nine Oscars</a></span></p><p>In the following, we'll take a look back at how Bruce's success in film ignited.

Of course, as fans know by now, that was just the start as the film enjoyed several successful films, especially at the box office.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>How Bruce Willis' Earnings From 'Die Hard' Changed Hollywood</a></span></p><p>The casting process was a crucial one for the film's success. There were a lot of risks in terms of the selections. Among the stars to thrive included Bonnie Bedelia. According to Star TV, she was put on the map for the film in large part, <a href=#>thanks to Bruce Willis having watched her recent work at the time.</a></p><p>"At the time that Die Hard was casting, Bedelia was a rising star nominated for a Golden Globe for her performance in Heart Like a Wheel."</p><p>Star TV continues, "Willis had caught the movie - about the first female drag-racer - and he was floored by Bedelia's performance. So he recommended her for the part of Holly Gennaro, and the studio agreed."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bedelia was the right choice for her role as Holly Gennaro.

Instead, at the time, he was enjoying his fame thanks to the TV series, Moonlighting.</p><p>According to Bonnie Bedelia, this was viewed as problematic by those in Hollywood and in addition, <a href=#>lots of people scoffed at his $5 million salary attached to the project.</a></p><p>Bedelia tells People, “You bet it was [his first big film]. It was kind of like a big thing when he got this because he was just on Moonlighting.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“This was his first movie, and he was the star of a huge blockbuster and it was very well advertised that he was making $5 million, which at the time was unbelievable,” she added. “And everybody was like, ‘Why would you pay $5 million to an untried movie star?’ But boy, someone was really smart.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Bruce Willis And Demi Moore's Nanny Claims 'She Was Denied A Social Life' While Working For The Couple</a></span></p><p>Bonnie Bedelia would also take part in the sequel, one that made $240 million at the box office.

Every once in a while, we’d stop to talk but he was very into the character."</p><p>Similar to what Bedelia had to say, Willis had lots of pressure to make the film work, given his salary and part in such a film.</p><p>“I think it was his first big film and he wanted to make it right, he wanted to make it work. He was more concerned with how to do the role rather than anything else.”</p><p>Clearly, Willis made it work, thriving in the role for years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZqKaenrJursSdnKWhkWLAosXSZp%2BopJyuxLC7w2akqJubmrFurtGump5lp565rbXSZqavnaJitaq%2FjKyYpZmirnqnu9Fmm6KdXZ2us7CO</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbonnie-bedelia-claims-hollywood-mocked-bruce-willis-over-his-5-million-salary-for-the-first-die-har.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbonnie-bedelia-claims-hollywood-mocked-bruce-willis-over-his-5-million-salary-for-the-first-die-har.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbonnie-bedelia-claims-hollywood-mocked-bruce-willis-over-his-5-million-salary-for-the-first-die-har.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbonnie-bedelia-claims-hollywood-mocked-bruce-willis-over-his-5-million-salary-for-the-first-die-har.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbonnie-bedelia-claims-hollywood-mocked-bruce-willis-over-his-5-million-salary-for-the-first-die-har.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbonnie-bedelia-claims-hollywood-mocked-bruce-willis-over-his-5-million-salary-for-the-first-die-har.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./brande-roderick-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./brande-roderick-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html>Brande Roderick Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./aew-all-out-review-aew-kicks-off-an-exciting-new-era.html>AEW All Out Review: AEW Kicks Off An Exciting New Era</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./aew-all-out-review-aew-kicks-off-an-exciting-new-era.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
