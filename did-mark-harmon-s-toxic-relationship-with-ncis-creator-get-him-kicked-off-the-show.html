Mark Harmon was a <a href=#>great colleague to work with, </a>even though some cast members like Pauley Perrette have said otherwise. Harmon worked very hard every day on NCIS, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">working with Bellisario was very difficult for him. </a>This conflict left the network with a tough decision to make: either keep the co-creator or let their lead character, Gibbs, exit.

Bellisario was heavily involved with NCIS, so much so that he called the shots regarding the show’s episodes and storylines for the characters. The tension caused friction between Bellisario and co-creator, Don McGill, and <strong>they eventually had a falling out, which ended with his departure from the hit CBS show</strong>. McGill shared with The Hollywood Reporter that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">leaving NCIS was the best decision for him </a>and his career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/instar43772401.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>McGill also expressed his disdain for Bellisario’s perfectionism on the show, which left the cast and crew exhausted from long hours of filming the first two seasons, to his satisfaction. If Bellisario didn’t like the script on the day of the shoot, he would tear it apart, which made it hard for the cast to know their lines. In the end, his way of working caused problems for the writers, crew and most of the cast, especially Mark Harmon.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:00</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ttweb_mark-harmon-almost-didn-t-play-jethro-gibbs-but-a-major-part-of-ncis-changed-his-mind_bk_a1_v4.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Mark Harmon Almost Didn't Play Jethro Gibbs, But A Major Part Of NCIS Changed His Mind">Mark Harmon Almost Didn't Play Jethro Gibbs, But A Major Part Of NCIS Changed His Mind</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Mark Harmon played Jethro Gibbs for 19 seasons of NCIS, but he almost turned down his biggest role before reading the script.</p><p>“Since he was the boss and a very successful producer, I thought it was best for me and the show that I leave and move on, which was what I did.”</p><p>NCIS began airing on CBS in 2003 after JAG creators Donald P. Bellisario and Don McGill wrote a two-episode pilot on JAG. The main cast when the show first aired were Mark Harmon as Jethro Gibbs, Michael Weatherly as Tony DiNozzo, Sasha Alexander as Caitlin Todd and Pauley Perrette as Abby Sciuto.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, NCIS didn’t take off until the third season, and by then, it had garnered a large following of committed viewers, even launching several spin-offs, including NCIS: Los Angeles and NCIS: New Orleans. Even though some of the <a href=#>spin-offs like NCIS:New Orleans were unsuccessful,</a> NCIS remained popular and is still running for 21 seasons.</p><h2 id=several-ncis-cast-members-had-issues-with-co-creator-bellisario>Several NCIS Cast Members Had Issues With Co-Creator, Bellisario</h2><p>McGill was one of many people on NCIS who had a problem with how Bellisario ran things on set. Sasha Alexander, one of the series regulars in the first two seasons, expressed her desire for change in how the co-creator was running the show and her character got killed off in response.<strong> "I love this show, but I just can't work this hard."</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/instar40632695.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bellisario harshly responded to Alexander, saying, "Good news, your workload is going to be lighter. But you're going to die." Then Bellisario killed her character from the show with a shot to the head that came as a shock to many longtime fans. Harmon, who was praised for his work ethic and team leadership with the cast and crew, even got to a point where he couldn't stand to work with Bellisario anymore.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/2-2-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Did Mark Harmon Get Along With His 'NCIS' Co-Stars?">Did Mark Harmon Get Along With His 'NCIS' Co-Stars?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Mark Harmon is one of the biggest stars on TV but do the cast of the show actually like him?</p><p>Executive producer Charles Floyd Johnson said, Harmon never told the producers to get rid of Bellisario. Harmon only said, “This is too hard, to work this way.” Since Harmon was a vital part of the show, the network wanted to make him happy, so they approached Bellisario with an offer. “Maybe you should work from a distance and not be quite as involved in terms of the way you work.”</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ncis-was-forced-to-separate-scenes-between-pauley-perrette-and-mark-harmon-after-things-took-a-turn-behind-the-scenes.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="NCIS Was Forced To Separate Scenes Between Pauley Perrette And Mark Harmon After Things Took A Turn Behind The Scenes">NCIS Was Forced To Separate Scenes Between Pauley Perrette And Mark Harmon After Things Took A Turn Behind The Scenes</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Pauley Perrette and Mark Harmon's feud got so bad that the two actors weren't allowed to film any scenes together for NCIS.</p><p>By the fifth year of NCIS, Bellisario had left the show.

During NCIS’ fourth season, <a href=#>Harmon was ready to leave the show.</a> The long working hours and harsh working conditions saw him threaten the producers with his departure. According to Harmon, Ballesario <strong>made it hard to meet deadlines by forcing writers to write new scripts at the last minute, which made memorizing lines hard for the cast.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Mark-Harmon-as-Gibbs-in-NCIS-via-The-Hollywood-Reporter.jpg><p>It got so bad that Harmon admitted the long working hours were affecting his life at home. Sources close to the show told TVGuide that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Harmon was very frustrated with Bellisario’s micromanaging and chaotic working style</a>, which had him working every single day for 16 hours.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Script pages get faxed to the set at the last minute, and Mark is tired of dealing with the huge impact that makes on his life. He doesn't have time for his family or anything when he's working hours like that."</p><p>Harmon eventually left NCIS in 2021 during season 19, but the network’s decision to give Bellisario the boot in 2007 meant he was serious about leaving. Bellisario left CBS but didn’t stop working on the show, staying on as executive producer. Harmon’s departure recently was not due to conflicts with his cast or crew. He was just tired of playing the same character. Though Harmon stayed on as executive producer, ensuring the series would go on successfully without him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikmqqbYrWivsyopaxlpKTFqq%2BMq5ylmaSevK%2B%2Fx6KnZqaTnsBur9GemK2nomKzqr7EnWY%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-mark-harmon-s-toxic-relationship-with-ncis-creator-get-him-kicked-off-the-show.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdid-mark-harmon-s-toxic-relationship-with-ncis-creator-get-him-kicked-off-the-show.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdid-mark-harmon-s-toxic-relationship-with-ncis-creator-get-him-kicked-off-the-show.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdid-mark-harmon-s-toxic-relationship-with-ncis-creator-get-him-kicked-off-the-show.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-mark-harmon-s-toxic-relationship-with-ncis-creator-get-him-kicked-off-the-show.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-mark-harmon-s-toxic-relationship-with-ncis-creator-get-him-kicked-off-the-show.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./leslie-wexner-net-worth-therichest.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./leslie-wexner-net-worth-therichest.html>Leslie Wexner Net Worth | TheRichest</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./cristiano-ronaldo-s-girlfriend-gave-him-a-rolls-royce-for-christmas.html>Cristiano Ronaldos Girlfriend Gave Him A Rolls Royce For Christmas</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./cristiano-ronaldo-s-girlfriend-gave-him-a-rolls-royce-for-christmas.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
