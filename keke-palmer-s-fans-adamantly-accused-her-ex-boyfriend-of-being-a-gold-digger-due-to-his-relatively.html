This is due to controversy surrounding her failed relationship with her baby's father, Darius Jackson.</p><p>For many people, seeing Keke Palmer at the center of such a controversy is disheartening, especially since some of Palmer's fans side-eyed Darius Jackson ever since he walked into the former Nickelodeon star's life. The questions about Darius Jackson's intentions naturally arose after fans did a little digging and found out that Darius Jackson isn't at Keke Palmer's level in terms of fortune and status.</p><p>Jackson didn't help his case when winning over Palmer's fans after <a href=#>he publicly humiliated her by calling her out on X (formerly known as Twitter) </a>when she appeared alongside Usher at a concert in a subjectively revealing outfit. Now that the couple are officially done, fans who accused Darius Jackson of being a gold digger believe their argument is now indisputable. This article will cover that, as well as Palmer's dating rules within the industry and the accusations she leveled against Jackson.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=keke-palmer-39-s-fans-believe-she-dated-a-gold-digger>Keke Palmer's Fans Believe She Dated A Gold Digger</h2><p>After Darius Jackson's infamous tweet that called out his then-girlfriend and baby mama, fans of Keke Palmer flocked to X to put him in his place.</p><p>One X user tweeted, "Keke Palmer is basically the breadwinner in the relationship, and they aren't married yet...".</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/keke-palmer-was-rumored-to-have-dated-a-small-number-of-celebrities-before-seeing-her-current-husband-darius-jackson.jpg><p>Another user echoed this sentiment, tweeting:</p><p>"Isn't Keke Palmer the bread winner... what is he talking about."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While doing so, the initial weariness and concern from Keke Palmer's fans resurfaced. This concern was that Darius Jackson was seeking clout and only dating Palmer for her growing fortune. According to Celebrity Net Worth, <strong>Keke Palmer's net worth is $7.5 million</strong>. This doesn't come as a shock due to her diligent and iconic work in the entertainment industry.</p><span class=txt>Close</span><p>Keke Palmer's net worth far exceeds that of her ex-boyfriend, Darius Jackson, whose net worth is estimated to be <strong>$500,000 to $1 million</strong>, according to InTouchWeekly.com.</p><p>Darius Jackson's net worth is attributed from his work as a <a href=#>fitness instructor for Inspire Studios. He also has an interest in entertainment</a>, though it doesn't seem that he's made much progress in that arena. With Jackson's occupation and pay stubs being drastically different from that of Palmer's, it's understandable why fans questioned his intentions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/halle-bailey.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Reason Halle Bailey Kept Her Pregnancy Private Revealed After Welcoming Baby Boy</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Halle Bailey was catapulted into fame last year thanks to The Little Mermaid, but she wanted to have a semblance of normalcy in her pregnancy.</span><p><strong>What Is Keke Palmer Doing Now?

Even though she dipped her toes in the celebrity pool of men, <a href=#>her dating history within the entertainment industry is fairly short</a>.</p><p>In a podcast episode of Baby, This Is Keke Palmer, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Palmer revealed that she prefers to date outside the entertainment industry.</a></p><p>"Here's the thing about me: I am not that attracted to people in the industry at that level...

However, Palmer's desire for a sliver of normalcy in her already public life turns her off from men in her field.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/untitled-design-copy-3.jpg><p>After that, Keke Palmer went on to reveal a misconception people have of celebrities dating other celebrities. "I've met nice guys in the industry... but I've always been like 'are you using me for clout?' See people assume celebrities should date together, you know... they feel like other people are looking for clout but celebrities [are] looking for clout more than the average person."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/keke-palmer-on-snl-pregnant-2.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Oddly Hilarious Way Keke Palmer Found Out She Was Pregnant</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>When Keke Palmer found out she was pregnant, it wasn't in the way one would expect.</span><p>This comment is ironic considering what fans think of Palmer's baby's father.</p><h2 id=keke-palmer-threw-shade-at-darius-jackson-amid-abuse-allegations>Keke Palmer Threw Shade At Darius Jackson Amid Abuse Allegations</h2><p>Sadly, Keke Palmer's relationship ended in an unfortunate way. Months after announcing her pregnancy, the media caught wind of<strong> Palmer's filed restraining order against Darius Jackson</strong>. According to The Cut, the public court document listed physical and emotional abuse throughout their two-year relationship. Along with this, Palmer is seeking custody over their shared child, Leodis "Leo" Andrellton.</p><p>As details continue to unfold surrounding Keke Palmer and Darius Jackson's crumbling relationship, Keke Palmer didn't miss a beat when throwing overt shade at Darius Jackson in recent music videos.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/instar52319143-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One video came after the Usher debacle. The song is entitled "Boyfriend," which featured Keke Palmer alongside Usher. At the end, Keke Palmer answers a phone call reminding her of a show she apparently slept through. After realizing this, she comically said, "I'm so tired. I'm a mother after all." A clear diss at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Darius Jackson's July 2023 tweet (which is now deleted)</a> that said "It's the outfit tho... you a mom."</p><p>Then, as Keke Palmer fought for a restraining order and custody of her son, she released "Assets." The song quite literally embodied the attitude many of Palmer's fans had toward the discrepancy in pay between Palmer and Jackson. If the title and lyrics (and timing) of the song and video didn't clue you in on Palmer's shade, then the skits that appeared at the beginning and end of the video left no room for interpretation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"These guys, man, they're a trip. I feel like they don't know what to do with a woman." Palmer said to a fictional Miss Pam (who is also played by a disguised Keke Palmer). And then later, as Palmer left the salon, Miss Pam shared her thoughts: "She always had it, didn't she? Baby daddy situation ghetto though. Gotta get that together."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiinqOVYr2iuMyeqaxllpa7tHnAnJquq5WZeqbEjJumsp6inrKvsIydmKuhpah6q63CpKqopl2Xsqq6xmaeqKSUYrGqs8aeqWacpZp6tbuMp5ytZaekv7W0jg%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkeke-palmer-s-fans-adamantly-accused-her-ex-boyfriend-of-being-a-gold-digger-due-to-his-relatively.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fkeke-palmer-s-fans-adamantly-accused-her-ex-boyfriend-of-being-a-gold-digger-due-to-his-relatively.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fkeke-palmer-s-fans-adamantly-accused-her-ex-boyfriend-of-being-a-gold-digger-due-to-his-relatively.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fkeke-palmer-s-fans-adamantly-accused-her-ex-boyfriend-of-being-a-gold-digger-due-to-his-relatively.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkeke-palmer-s-fans-adamantly-accused-her-ex-boyfriend-of-being-a-gold-digger-due-to-his-relatively.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkeke-palmer-s-fans-adamantly-accused-her-ex-boyfriend-of-being-a-gold-digger-due-to-his-relatively.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./lauren-lapkus-what-s-in-my-bag.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./lauren-lapkus-what-s-in-my-bag.html>Lauren Lapkus: Whats in My Bag?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./izzy-vinny-and-i-have-communicated-a-lot-since-bip-split.html>Izzy: Vinny and I Have Communicated a Lot Since BIP Split</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./izzy-vinny-and-i-have-communicated-a-lot-since-bip-split.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
