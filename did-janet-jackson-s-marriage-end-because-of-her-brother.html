In a lot of cases, that seems to be hyperbole but in a few rare occurrences, that really seems to be the case. For example, throughout history, there have been some <a href=#>families that took the music world by storm</a>. Of course, it could easily be argued that the Jackson family is among the most impactful clans in music history. After all, The Jackson 5 released many hit songs, and Michael and Janet were the biggest pop stars in the world at various points.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the years, there has been a lot of sensational coverage of several members of the Jackson family. On top of that, a lot of people have often wondered <a href=#>how close members of the Jackson family are</a> to one another. However, there are ample reasons to think that almost all of the Jacksons have remained loyal to one another. After all, <a href=#>when Michael stood trial</a>, most of his family stood by his side. On top of that, one of Janet’s brothers played a major role in her marriage ending and that is a really good thing.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Michael Jackson Was Hiding His Family From The Press Just Prior To His Death</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=janet-jackson-rsquo-s-third-marriage-allegedly-was-abusive>Janet Jackson’s Third Marriage Allegedly Was Abusive</h2><p>Ever since Janet Jackson was a little girl, she has been in the spotlight to a certain extent. As a result of spending so much of her life in the public eye, her millions of fans have been able to learn an awful lot about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Janet’s love life</a>. For example, it is known that Janet was married to James DeBarge, René Elizondo Jr., and Wissam Al Mana in the past. The press has also reported on Janet’s other relationships with people like Jermain Dupri and Bobby Brown. Finally, there have been Janet’s rumored romances with Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson, Q-Tip, Justin Timberlake, and Matthew McConaughey.</p><p>Sadly, Janet Jackson’s fans have also learned that her third marriage allegedly was abusive by the time it ended. After all, when he was interviewed by People in 2017, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Randy Jackson claimed that Wissam Al Mana habitually mistreated Janet</a> by the time their marriage came to an end.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“It was quite an abusive situation. It came on later in the relationship, verbal abuse and being [made to feel like] a prisoner in her own home. No pregnant woman needs to go through being called a b***h every day. There were things like that. That’s what she went through.” While talking to People, Randy made it clear that the abuse never became physical but that certainly doesn’t make it ok.</p><p>When they put together their article that resulted from Randy Jackson’s comments, People reached out to Wissam Al Mana for comment. In response, Al Mana’s lawyers put out a statement that read; “Mr. Al Mana is not going to dignify these particular and deeply hurtful allegations with a response. The breakdown of his marriage to Janet Jackson is a cause of great sadness to Mr. Al Mana, and it is the well-being and privacy of their son, Eissa, that remains his sole focus.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Janet Jackson’s Biopic Is In The Works...

For example, in some cases, the person who wants to get divorced finds it hard to make that move because they feel like there is nowhere they can turn to for support. Fortunately for Janet Jackson, however, when it became clear that she needed to end her latest marriage, she could turn to her family.</p><p>In late-2017, an anonymous Jackson family insider spoke to Page Six about the circumstances of Janet Jackson’s third divorce. After confirming Randy Jackson’s claims that Wissam Al Mana was an abusive husband, the insider revealed that Janet’s brother played a huge role in her divorcing him.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Stars Who Were Open About Being In Abusive Romantic Relationships</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“The family insider explained how Randy orchestrated his sister’s departure from the London home she shared with Al Mana. He quietly arranged for their older sister Rebbie and mother Katherine to fly to London to visit Janet — and map a way out. The trio gave her the strength to ‘leave her controlling husband,’ the source added.”</p><p>Assuming that everything that the Jackson family insider claimed was true, it seems clear that Randy, Rebbie, and Katherine Jackson were all there for Janet in her time of need. While everyone hopes that they never find themselves in the situation that Janet reportedly was in at the end of her marriage, anyone who does wind up there should be given lots of support.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Janet Jackson Fans Think She Is 'Not Ready' To Forgive Justin Timberlake</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihmqaVqXqrrcKkqqimXZ3CtK7Ap5tmamBnfm6wyK%2Bmq5uVYsSqv9KapGaZnGK6orrAZpibraOaerOtzZ2wZpqipMGpsdFo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-janet-jackson-s-marriage-end-because-of-her-brother.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdid-janet-jackson-s-marriage-end-because-of-her-brother.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdid-janet-jackson-s-marriage-end-because-of-her-brother.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdid-janet-jackson-s-marriage-end-because-of-her-brother.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-janet-jackson-s-marriage-end-because-of-her-brother.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-janet-jackson-s-marriage-end-because-of-her-brother.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./ella-henderson-boyfriend-net-worth-tattoos-smoking-body-measurements.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./ella-henderson-boyfriend-net-worth-tattoos-smoking-body-measurements.html>Ella Henderson: Boyfriend, net worth, tattoos, smoking &amp;amp; body measurements</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./did-dolly-parton-s-relationship-with-porter-wagoner-suffer-irreparable-damage-after-he-sued-her-for.html>Did Dolly Parton's Relationship With Porter Wagoner Suffer Irreparable Damage After He Sued Her For</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./did-dolly-parton-s-relationship-with-porter-wagoner-suffer-irreparable-damage-after-he-sued-her-for.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
