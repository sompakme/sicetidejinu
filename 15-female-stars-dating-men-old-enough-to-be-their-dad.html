We see it all the time. But how old is too old? When the guy is basically old enough to be her father, is that just too far into the whole “May-December” romance world? Well, not for these 15 celeb ladies who like their fellas aged to perfection. You know, just like a fine wine.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They say, “Age ain’t nothin’ but a number,” but it seems to mean something when the age gap is the other way around (in most cases anyhow). But these female stars have no issue with a major age difference, proving that dating someone around their dads’ age is totally cool. What their dads think about it is another story.</p><p>Perhaps the men their age are just not mature enough, or they have a “type.” The type being a guy who is going grey or has already arrived at the “salt and pepper” station. Maybe these gals appreciate their fellas’ worldliness, self-assuredness, or old-fashioned ways. Hey, ya gotta respect your elders, right? Whatever the case may be for the attraction, the older guys are lucking out on snagging a youthful woman to call their main squeeze.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Here are 15 female stars who are dating or married to men old enough to be their father. These well-seasoned men are just spicy enough for younger women to find irresistible. Maybe when their men are in their 80s and 90s, they will have a different opinion on the matter.</p><h2 id=sofia-richie-and-scott-disick><strong>Sofia Richie And Scott Disick</strong></h2><p>The 19-year-old model and daughter of musician Lionel Richie, Sofia Richie, is reportedly dating the much older reality star dad-of-three, Scott Disick, age 34. Being that she is still a teen, this age gap is causing a stir. Since we always see Disick either trying to win back the affections of his “baby mama,” Kourtney Kardashian or parading from city to city with a different gal on his arm, seeing him getting cozy with Richie is a shocker to some, probably mostly to her dad. At 19, why she would opt to date a man with three kids is the question on many folks’ minds, but she must find “The Lord”&nbsp;foxy&nbsp;and fun to be with. Will this romance last? Only time will tell. We wonder what Kris Jenner thinks about the couple.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hilaria-thomas-baldwin-and-alec-baldwin><strong>Hilaria (Thomas) Baldwin And Alec Baldwin</strong></h2><p>The 34-year-old yoga expert Hilaria Baldwin is the wife of actor Alec Baldwin who is much older than his beautiful wife. He will turn 60 in a couple of months, making their age gap quite impressive. They have three children together with another on the way, and he has another grown child (Ireland Baldwin) from his previous marriage to the amazing actress, Kim Basinger. They divorced in 2002. Thanks to his fun-loving spirit and wild sense of humor, we can see why a younger woman would fall for the actor. Not to mention, he’s quite handsome. Now that little kids are in the picture, the actor better keep fit so he can run after the wee ones. We know Hilaria is in great shape, but with four kids, she’ll need some help from their papa.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mary-kate-olsen-and-olivier-sarkozy><strong>Mary-Kate Olsen And Olivier Sarkozy</strong></h2><p>Mary-Kate Olsen is a savvy business woman with lots of success under her belt, and we have known the twin since she was a tot on television with her sister Ashley on the hit TV show Full House. She is now 31-years-old and is married to a much older gent, Olivier Sarkozy, a French Banker who is 48. Not only is their age difference major, but so is their impressive height difference. She is a petite 5’ 2” and her man is 6’ 3.” When this couple first made their relationship public, many people were floored. Who would have ever expected these two to hit it off, let alone meet in the first place? But cupid has a funny way of bringing people together, and they got hitched in 2015.</p><h2 id=annalynne-mccord-and-dominic-purcell><strong>AnnaLynne McCord And Dominic Purcell</strong></h2><p>The blonde and beautiful 30-year-old actress and model AnnaLynne McCord is (on again, off again) dating the buff and hunky Prison Break actor Dominic Purcell, who is 48 years old. The two stars make a great looking couple, and the big age difference between them does not seem to faze them. McCord and Purcell originally split up in ’14 but then got back together in '17 after Purcell was sadly diagnosed with skin cancer. Who knows if this relationship will ever result in a marriage, but when you get back together with an ex, it must mean something special. This pretty pair may have a wide age gap, but they seem close in every other way. Fans are surely rooting for them to be happy, whether they remain romantic partners or head toward "splitsville" yet again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rosie-huntington-whiteley-and-jason-statham><strong>Rosie Huntington Whiteley And Jason Statham</strong></h2><p>The stunning 30-year-old model and actress Rosie Huntington Whiteley is in a relationship with the much older actor Jason Statham, who is 50 years old. The decades-apart couple has been together since 2010 and they are still going strong. Since she was only 22 when they first got together, many people thought the relationship would never last the long haul, but these lovebirds are still smitten with one another. First of all, they must have a mutual physical attraction. Just look at these two! But along with the physical, the two must have a lot in common and appreciate one another for more than good looks alone. Will they ever tie the knot? Let’s wait and see if this May-December duo says, “I do” one day soon. Fans would love for this Hollywood couple to make it “official.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kelsi-taylor-and-dane-cook><strong>Kelsi Taylor And Dane Cook</strong></h2><p>The 19-year-old singer and artist Kelsi Taylor is dating comedian/actor Dane Cook, who is 45 years old. This rather large age gap is particularly head-turning, since Taylor is still just a teen. Yes, she is “legal,” but for a 45-year-old, that is quite a big gap. But who are we to judge if they are happy and in love? Age apparently plays no factor in their romantic relationship, and they seem like they are going strong after dating steadily for more than a year. Cook is a comedian, so Taylor must adore his silly sense of humor, and he must be smitten with his gal’s raw talent and evident beauty. Will this May-December couple last? We will have to wait and see. At 19, Taylor may have a new perspective on men in a couple of years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=amber-tamblyn-and-david-cross><strong>Amber Tamblyn And David Cross</strong></h2><p>Actress/author/director Amber Tamblyn is 34 years old and has been married to comedian/actor/writer/director David Cross since 2012. He is 53 years old, making their age gap quite significant. They have one child together and their relationship is still going strong. Heck, 6 years of marriage by Hollywood standards is indeed a long time! Tamblyn seems like she is a mature lady, making her choice to be with a man almost 20 years older than she is understandable. Regardless of age, this celeb couple seems well-suited for one another and their fans must agree. We have seen the talented Tamblyn on the small and big screens for years, and fans adored the actress in the film The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants. Did her hubby Cross see the popular flick and fall in love too?</p><h2 id=catherine-zeta-jones-and-michael-douglas><strong>Catherine Zeta-Jones And Michael Douglas</strong></h2><p>The beautiful and talented actress Catherine Zeta-Jones is 48 years old and her actor hubby, the incomparable Michael Douglass is 73. They have been married since 2000 and their relationship is still tight. They have a large age gap between them, but the romance is alive and well. Both are A-list stars with fans who have adored their work for decades. Together they have two children and Douglas has another grown son from a previous relationship. Fans of the stars are always impressed by their work on film as well as their admiration for and devotion to one another. They are Hollywood royalty and will continue to shine in the spotlight for years to come. The age difference has not stopped these two from making a special life together, even with the pressures of fame weighing down on them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=beth-ostrosky-stern-and-howard-stern><strong>Beth (Ostrosky) Stern And Howard Stern</strong></h2><p>The 45-year-old animal-lover Beth Stern is married to “shock jock” Howard Stern, who is considerably older than his gorgeous model wife. He is 64. The New York-based couple has been married for 10 years and seem to be over-the-moon in love with one another. Those who know the couple find them to be the perfect match, despite their wide age gap and seemingly different lives. But the two have a lot in common, from their mutual attraction to one another to their love of pets. Howard has three children from a previous marriage, but he has none with his current wife. Considering how many pets they foster in their home, who has time for kids anyway? A nearly 20-year age gap doesn’t stop this couple from doing their thing and proving those who said it wouldn’t last wrong.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=paige-butcher-and-eddie-murphy><strong>Paige Butcher And Eddie Murphy</strong></h2><p>The 38-year-old Australian-born Paige Butcher is in a serious relationship with actor/comedian Eddie Murphy who is many years her senior. Murphy is 56 and almost two decades older than his bronzed and blonde babe. Butcher is a model and actress, and she is the mother of Murphy’s 9th child. We’ve known Murphy for decades, from his hilarious standup comedy acts to his roles on the small and big screen, and everything in between. Butcher is now in the limelight more than ever before as Murphy’s main squeeze. She is certainly a stunning woman, something that likely caught Murphy’s eye from the get go. And they must have more than common than most would think, considering they are nearly 20 years apart. Will this romance last? If they are in love, what’s to stop them? Not 18 years, anyhow.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=calista-flockhart-and-harrison-ford><strong>Calista Flockhart And Harrison Ford</strong></h2><p>Actress Calista Flockhart is 53-years-old and her spouse since 2010, actor Harrison Ford is 75. This May-December couple doesn’t let the age difference hinder their romance. They are deeply in love and make for an interesting and dynamic A-list couple. Fans have adored Flockhart for years, especially in her role on television’s Ally McBeal. And the work of Ford is impressive, to say the least. Some of his hit films include Star Wars, Blade Runner, The Fugitive, Air Force One, Patriot Games, Working Girl, Sabrina, and Regarding Henry, to name a few. Surely his wife is as big a fan as the rest of us are, but she is the lucky one who stole his heart. It seems like this couple will be together forever. A 22-year age gap is no biggie for these lovers.</p><h2 id=emma-heming-willis-and-bruce-willis><strong>Emma Heming-Willis And Bruce Willis</strong></h2><p>The magnificent model and actress Emma Hemming-Willis is 39 years old and she is the wife of actor Bruce Willis who is 62. Together, they have two young children, but Bruce has three grown daughters from his marriage to actress Demi Moore which ended in 2000. The attractive couple married in 2009 and are still going strong. The large age gap is not on their radar, even though the rest of us sat up and took notice when they first got together. These two are like peas in a pod, making every moment together count. They adore their daughters and one another. Surely Emma was a fan of her man’s work before they got together. With films like Die Hard, Pulp Fiction, 12 Monkeys, The Whole Nine Yards, and Sin City, how could she not?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=amal-alamuddin-clooney-and-george-clooney><strong>Amal (Alamuddin) Clooney And George Clooney</strong></h2><p>The beautiful and remarkable Amal Clooney is 40 years old and the wife of actor George Clooney since they tied the knot in 2014. George is 56, but the significant age gap is no issue for this couple who recently welcomed twins. Folks thought George would never get married again, but Amal stole his heart and they have been inseparable ever since. People often forget that George was once married before, from 1989 to 1993 to actress Talia Balsam. But he had been a bachelor for so long that fans thought he’d never settle down and get married. That was before the alluring Amal crossed his path. These two lovebirds seem like the perfect match and we are so glad to see them in love. Those twins have some pretty impressive parents!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kayte-walsh-and-kelsey-grammer><strong>Kayte Walsh And Kelsey Grammer</strong></h2><p>The blonde and beautiful 39-year-old Kayte Walsh is the wife of actor Kelsey Grammer who is much older than she is. Grammer is 62, making their May-December relationship yet another Hollywood staple. The two met when Walsh was a flight attendant and they started dating in 2010. The couple has three children together and Grammer has other children from previous relationships. Grammer is famous for his acting roles on television shows including Frasier, Cheers, and Wings and he has been in a number of films including Storks, Toy Story 2, Swing Vote, Fame, and Middle Men, to name a few. Will this romance last? Let’s hope so, as Grammer has had a few misses in the marriage department thus far. If they could find love in flight above the clouds, maybe it was meant to be.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ashley-olsen-and-richard-sachs><strong>Ashley Olsen And Richard Sachs</strong></h2><p>Mary-Kate is not the only Olsen twin to have a fetish for older fellas. The 31-year-old was dating Richard Sachs, nearly 60 years old. Looks like twin Ashley Olsen wins the prize for dating a man even older than her sister’s fella. Sachs is a financier who apparently has a thing for much younger women. The two were an item for a while until they called it quits last year. But perhaps they will realize they were meant to be and get back together one day, as reports reveal the two are “still friends.” Have they heard of “friends with benefits?” Such a relationship may work out just fine for this May-December pair. Although, perhaps Olsen realized the nearly 30-year age gap was a bit excessive and maybe a man closer to her own age would suit her better.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmhqYGKzprnApZxmq6SWv7R5w5qroqaXYrqmuoyoo51llaO8trPHZquoZZKaerW0xKKpZpyRmXw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f15-female-stars-dating-men-old-enough-to-be-their-dad.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f15-female-stars-dating-men-old-enough-to-be-their-dad.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f15-female-stars-dating-men-old-enough-to-be-their-dad.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f15-female-stars-dating-men-old-enough-to-be-their-dad.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f15-female-stars-dating-men-old-enough-to-be-their-dad.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f15-female-stars-dating-men-old-enough-to-be-their-dad.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./adam-rodriguez-net-worth-therichest.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./adam-rodriguez-net-worth-therichest.html>Adam Rodriguez Net Worth | TheRichest</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./10-dead-celebrities-that-are-still-making-millions.html>10 Dead Celebrities That Are Still Making Millions</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./10-dead-celebrities-that-are-still-making-millions.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
