We get along so well and so do our families.”</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The rumors regarding whether or not her friendship with Richards post-filming are clearly false. The ‘Wizard of Oz’ curtain was pulled back only to reveal that everything was exactly as it seemed in the Hollywood Hills field of California poppies.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>We had to ask if this genuine tie to the OG Beverly Hills cast member will mean a reappearance as a ‘friend of’ role on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>RHOBH</span></i><span style=font-weight:400>, to which she simply teased, “Maybe, maybe not.”</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><b>When do you think there was a turning point in your friendship with Dorit?

But we’re able to always work past them.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Mellencamp also noted that their children get along super well, and she recently saw Dorit just the other day. The thing about friends working out tensions on TV, which she delved into with no emotional wall to break down, is that every little tone of annoyance is made public.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Have we ever gotten upset over a friend saying an off-comment during a girl’s night out?

Did he give you a reason behind their decision?</strong> "I like to keep it real! No, he didn’t, but everything happens for a reason. I’m excited for what’s to come next!"In a matter of months in quarantine, she moved into a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">beautiful Encino home</a> and gave birth to her daughter Dove. She's already manifested what's to come next, and that's not even including her goals vision board that she keeps under wraps. <span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Exclusive: Teddi Mellencamp Reveals She's Working On An ALL IN TV Show</a></span> <strong>What’s your opinion on other Housewives when they claim they decided to leave?</strong> "I would venture to guess 98% of them are playing loose with reality."She may have gotten an unruly amount of heat for being "boring" on the show, but he life is anything but. How is someone who handles pot stirrers with grace and makes genuine friendships in the city of diamonds thrown into that category? <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> Mellencamp's thoughts on her former castmates, however, weren't completely absent of discontentment.When we asked for a comment on Lisa Vanderpump's podcast episode in which she metaphorically added fuel to the fire of her&nbsp; Real Housewives departure, Mellencamp wasn't bothered. <strong>What was your reaction to Lisa Vanderpump's comments on her podcast after you announced your departure?</strong> "I didn’t know she had a podcast."Whether that was her taking the high road or sprinkling a subtle amount of shade, we're here for it. Side note, she has her own pop culture-based podcast <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;Teddi Tea Podcast</a> .[caption id="attachment_1132526" align="alignnone" width="2000"] <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/teddi-mellencamp-bravo.jpeg alt="teddi mellencamp bravo" width=2000 height=2400 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> Via: Refinery29[/caption] <span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'Real Housewife' Teddi Mellencamp Has Her Third Child...

Does it make you feel like you couldn’t win with the audience?</strong> "You know, I went into things just reacting authentically. You can’t gauge how the audience will react. So it is what it is. But those tweets can be brutal!"While keyboard warriors way feel a vindictive kind of satisfaction after posting a cruel tweet, Mellencamp has fostered a mindset that blocks out that negativity. She's proud of her surf town beach house, which she still has, and her ability to stay true to herself throughout the show.[EMBED_INSTA]https://www.instagram.com/p/CNILVDLhKlk/[/EMBED_INSTA] <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <strong>Do you think the overemphasis on glam squads was harmful? Both shaming women for using them and shaming those who didn’t care for them?</strong> "I think whatever makes someone happy is how they should approach things. Whatever everybody else thinks is white noise."<p>She doesn't take a strong stance when it comes to glam squads. While they were only initially used for special events on&nbsp;Real Housewives, she noted that soon enough the women were hiring them for everything. Basically, if they make you feel confident, go for it.</p><strong>Will we be seeing you in the much anticipated 11th season of RHOBH as a friend?</strong> "Maybe, maybe not..." <span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Teddi Mellencamp Shares Heartfelt Birthday Message To Kyle Richards</a></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicsZucqsCqwsRmq56clJ56rrHLpZynm5GivW6%2BxJ%2BjnpukqHqwuoyhnKtlop28o7SMnq%2BirF2Wu6V50Z6jmqyZpLu0tMipqmavmam1brLOq6Seql2YrrTAzJqrnqtf</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fexclusive-teddi-mellencamp-reflects-on-her-rhobh-exit-and-relationships-with-former-castmates.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fexclusive-teddi-mellencamp-reflects-on-her-rhobh-exit-and-relationships-with-former-castmates.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fexclusive-teddi-mellencamp-reflects-on-her-rhobh-exit-and-relationships-with-former-castmates.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fexclusive-teddi-mellencamp-reflects-on-her-rhobh-exit-and-relationships-with-former-castmates.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fexclusive-teddi-mellencamp-reflects-on-her-rhobh-exit-and-relationships-with-former-castmates.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fexclusive-teddi-mellencamp-reflects-on-her-rhobh-exit-and-relationships-with-former-castmates.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./in-a-controversial-move-mariah-carey-sells-her-mother-s-home-for-757-444.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./in-a-controversial-move-mariah-carey-sells-her-mother-s-home-for-757-444.html>In A Controversial Move, Mariah Carey Sells Her Mother's Home For $757,444</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./dax-milne-contract-40-time-draft-family-wiki-salary-net-worth-height.html>Dax Milne Contract, 40 Time, Draft, Family, Wiki, Salary, Net Worth, Height</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./dax-milne-contract-40-time-draft-family-wiki-salary-net-worth-height.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
