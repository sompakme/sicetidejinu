Though current estimates place her net worth at a modest $40 million, Sweeney’s lavish real estate acquisitions tell a different story, fueling further <strong><a href=#>confusion around her rapidly growing net worth</a></strong>. In this article, we dive into the insane real estate purchases Sweeney has splurged on, including <strong>her new ocean-front South Florida mansion</strong>.

While current estimates peg <strong>her net worth at around $40 million</strong>, Sweeney's real estate portfolio hints at a level of wealth that far exceeds these figures.</p><span class=txt>Close</span><p>The now 26-year-old has splurged on some pretty opulent properties in recent years. <strong>Her first big buy was a stunning 3,200-square-foot mansion </strong>in L.A.'s Westwood neighborhood, snapped up for a cool $3 million in 2021. According to Architectural Digest, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">the multi-million-dollar Tudor-inspired home</a> boasts five bedrooms, four bathrooms, a brick patio, an outdoor fireplace, and a barbecue, all on a lush 0.27-acre lot.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">told the Associated Press of the purchase</a> in 2021:</p><p>"I always thought that when I turned 18, I’d have all this money and I’d buy back my parents’ house and put them all back together again. And I never was able to, and I never did. So now being able to be in a house is such an incredible, humbling, amazing accomplishment that I still can’t believe I was able to pull off."</p><p>Just a year later, the Euphoria star made an appearance on The Kelly Clarkson Show, where <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">she revealed that <strong>she’d bought back her great-grandmother’s house</strong></a><strong> for an undisclosed amount</strong>.</p><p>"My great-grandma had this beautiful house, it's a two-bedroom, cute house that they lived in. My grandma was born in it. My mom was born in it, and then as the kids got older, they built on the property another home,” she shared.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“And when my great-grandpa passed away and my great-grandma got old, they just couldn't afford to keep it anymore...It was a lot.

The mansion, which sparked a bidding war and ended up fetching a whopping $250,000 over the asking price, features five bedrooms and four bathrooms and sits on a 1.25-acre heavily wooded lot.</p><h2 id=sydney-sweeney-rsquo-s-most-lavish-real-estate-is-a-south-florida-mega-mansion>Sydney Sweeney’s Most Lavish Real Estate Is A South Florida Mega-Mansion</h2><p>With three properties, each purchased for less than $10 million, Sydney Sweeney's real estate portfolio is well within reach for someone with a reported $40 million net worth. However, the Euphoria star is far from finished expanding her real estate portfolio, and <strong>her most recent purchase suggests that her net worth might be growing at a far more exponential pace than previously thought</strong>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/sydney-sweeney-madame-web-premiere.jpg><p>According to DailyMail, <strong>Sweeney was in the final stages of negotiations to </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><strong>purchase a 7,000-square-foot mansion </strong>in South Florida</a> for a whopping $20 million as of June 2024. However, Page Six confirms <strong>she purchased it for $13.5 million</strong>. Per TMZ, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">the oceanfront property is loaded with top-of-the-line amenities</a>, including “a heated and chilled infinity pool with a swim-up bar complete with underwater barstools, a chef's kitchen, wine room, an elevator, a home gym, a game room, and a boat launch.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:30</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ttweb_how-jacob-elordi-s-net-worth-grew-by-millions-in-just-a-few-years_bk_a1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="How Jacob Elordi's Net Worth Grew By Millions In Just A Few Years">How Jacob Elordi's Net Worth Grew By Millions In Just A Few Years</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Jacob Elordi had just $800 in the bank before landing his role in Euphoria, but now the actor is worth millions.</p><p>The alleged $20 million real estate splurge might seem contradictory to some, given Sweeney’s lower-than-expected net worth. In February 2024, Celebrity Net Worth pegged her net worth at around $10 million but bumped the estimate up to a whopping $40 million just months later. These <strong>ever-changing estimates, combined with Sweeney’s rapidly expanding real estate empire</strong>, suggest that her actual net worth might be far higher than previously imagined.</p><h2 id=sydney-sweeney-has-been-rather-vocal-about-her-financial-struggles-in-the-past>Sydney Sweeney Has Been Rather Vocal About Her Financial Struggles In The Past</h2><p>Sydney Sweeney’s alleged $13.5 million real estate splurge might come as a bit of a shock to some, considering <strong>Sweeney’s <a href=#>previous comments about her financial situation</a>. </strong>In July 2022, the Euphoria star roused controversy after <strong>she appeared to complain about her financial situation </strong>in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter.</p><p>“They don’t pay actors like they used to, and with streamers, you no longer get residuals. The established stars still get paid, but I have to give 5 percent to my lawyer, 10 percent to my agents, 3 percent or something like that to my business manager. I have to pay my publicist every month, and that’s more than my mortgage.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/sydney-sweeney-2.jpg><p>She continued:</p><p>“If I wanted to take a six-month break, I don’t have income to cover that. I don’t have someone supporting me, I don’t have anyone I can turn to, to pay my bills or call for help.”</p><p>However, given her meteoric rise in Hollywood, <strong>it wouldn't be surprising if those financial woes are now ancient history</strong>. Afterall, Sweeney boasts multiple income streams, all with the potential to multiply her net worth several times over within a couple of years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although most of Sweeney's career earnings aren't available, World Celebs estimated that <strong>she raked in an estimated $350,000 per episode for her recurring role on Euphoria</strong>. The now 26-year-old also reportedly took home a cool <strong>$25,000 per episode for season one of The White Lotus</strong>, per Forbes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/sydney-sweeney-hbo-s-euphoria-la-premiere.jpg><p><strong>Sweeney is also credited as an executive producer on several of her films</strong>, including the 2023 romantic comedy Anyone but You, which brought in a whopping $219.6 million at the box office against a modest $25 million budget. Though it remains unclear how much Sweeney took home from the film, it was likely a hefty sum given her dual role in the production.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The 26-year-old also presumably <strong>banks a steady income from her production company</strong>, Fifty-Fifty Films.
