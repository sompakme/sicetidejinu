As such, he seemed to appear out of nowhere when he performed at Coachella in 2012. However, for those in the know, Tesfaye was writing about life and <a href=#>his love interests</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">was already incredibly influential in the R&B scene</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did The Weeknd And Lily Rose Depp's Relationship Become Complicated When Filming HBO's The Idol?</a></span></p><p>What is interesting about Tesfaye is that when he started out, he did not want to be noticed. He only wanted his music to be heard. As such, the mixed tapes that he put out on YouTube never showed his face. For a time, fans did not know if The Weeknd was a band or a single performer. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">It was this mystery that helped to launch Tesfaye's career</a>.</p><p>While this was a "calculated" move on Tesfaye's part, it was also done because The Idol star did not think he was "marketable" because he did not have "the right look." Both of these proved to be wrong given the success The Weeknd has had in the decade since the world learned just who Tesfaye was by <a href=#>changing the rules of conventional R&B forever</a>. He's also earned a decent net worth through his work in music.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-weeknd-is-worth-around-300-million>The Weeknd Is Worth Around $300 Million</h2><p>In the 10-plus years that The Weeknd has been part of the R&B scene, he has made a staggering amount of money for himself. But with the talent that Tesfaye has shown since day one, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">it is not hard to see why his net worth is so high</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar52748754.png><p>Tesfaye is worth $300 million. This fortune came from putting a lot of hard work into the sound of his music, not shying away from darker-sounding R&B music, and then promoting the heck out of it.</p><p>Given the fact that Tesfaye was a high school dropout who used illegal substances at one point in his life, even he has to be blown away by what he has accomplished in such a short time.</p><h2></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-weeknd-and-other-celebrities-that-use-alter-egos>The Weeknd And Other Celebrities That Use Alter Egos</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong><strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only is Tesfaye recognized financially for his music, but he has also received critical acclaim for his over 70 million records sold. This is because the Blinding Lights singer has been <a href=#>named one of the most awarded artists of all time</a>, being awarded several Grammy Awards, American Music Awards, Juno Awards, and Billboard Awards.</p><p>Since Tesfaye is still at the beginning of his career, there is likely more money to be made and more awards to be won.</p><h2 id=how-the-weeknd-made-his-fortune>How The Weeknd Made His Fortune</h2><p>Given The Weeknd's success with selling over 70 million records, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">much of his fortune can be attributed to fans purchasing music</a>. However, Tesfaye does much more than put out music. And his net worth is reflected by that.</p><p>The first albums that Tesfaye put out were done without the backing of a record label. This is where the Reminder singer got his following from. As such, when his studio albums, Kiss Land, Behind the Madness, and <a href=#>Starboy were released</a>, they were instant hits. This is where a chunk of Tesfaye's money was made.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar52277650-1.jpg><p>Of course, to keep selling albums, tours need to be done. And with Tesfaye's loyal fans, he has no problem with selling out arenas and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">grossing tens of millions in the process</a>. This can be seen in 2022 alone when the Save Your Tears singer grossed over $131 million for his After Hours Til Dawn tour.</p><p>More impressively, however, is what Tesfaye did for his 2017 Starboy: Legend of the Fall tour. Before even performing, the I Was Never There singer managed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">turn his billions of streamed downloads into an advance of $75 million</a>. And while he made all that money and more, it was clear that Tesfaye's label believed in him and his music to advance a sum that large.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to stadium tours, Tesfaye also performs at festivals. His favorite, Coachella, not only introduced The Weeknd to fans but allows for a good payday as well. With his <a href=#>most recent Coachella paying $8.5 million</a>, that is not too shabby for a day's work.</p><p>As if <a href=#>making music about former flames</a> and touring were not enough, Tesfaye has businesses he has collaborated with that bring in some serious cash as well. Those companies, according to Celebrity Net Worth include everything from esports to e-cigarettes, coffee and condoms, and even fashion brands, H&M, Alexander Wang, Puma, Victoria's Secret, and more.</p><p>If that was not enough, Tesfaye also has his own fashion and accessory line, XO.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Is The Weeknd Really The Reason Why Bella Hadid Keeps Her Boyfriend Out Of The Spotlight?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And just because Tesfaye is not insanely successful enough, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he has also taken the foray into acting</a>. Most recently with The Idol<a href=#>starring himself and a cult leader</a> and Lily-Rose Depp, <a href=#>with whom there was a rumored romance</a>.</p><p>Wth several upcoming projects, there is no telling what the future has in store for the talented entertainer.</p><h2 id=how-the-weeknd-spends-his-fortune>How The Weeknd Spends His Fortune</h2><p>Tesfaye has a love for real estate. As such, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he spends a good deal of his money on properties that are not only breathtaking but unique as well</a>.</p><p>One of the first big purchases that Tesfaye made was a home in Hidden Hills, Ca. In 2017, the Creepin' singer spent $18.2 million for the three-acre homestead. After several years, however, Tesfaye wanted to move up.</p><p>He sold the home for $19.3 million to none other than Madonna, <a href=#>who now is looking to make a profit on the home herself</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/instar50274710-1-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The next big purchase for real estate put the Hidden Hills home to shame. This is because Tesfaye spent $70 million on his current home in Bel Air, Ca.</p><p>Purchasing luxury cars is also how Tesfaye spends his money. And with dropping <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$2.5 million on several different brands of cars</a> from the McLaren P1 to a Bentley Mulsanne, several Mercedes, and more, Tesfaye is driving in style no matter what car he chooses to drive for the day.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Another big indulgence that Tesfaye spends his money on is eclectic art</a>. With everything from sculptures to paintings, photography, and everything in between, Tesfaye does not discriminate in what he buys. As such, his home decor looks much like a modern art gallery, reflecting the Blinding Lights singer's personality to a T.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Weeknd Receives Praise As He Donates $1 Million To Fight Hunger In Ethiopia</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tesfaye works hard for his money. That hard work has paid off in spades when it comes to amassing a fortune that very few in the entertainment industry will ever see. Because he is still in the early years of his career, Tesfaye will only continue to grow his fortune with each album he releases.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1drLKmt82dZJqalaF6tbHSn5iynV2jsrV51qipraBf</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-weeknd-is-worth-a-surprising-amount-of-money-here-s-how-he-earned-it.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-weeknd-is-worth-a-surprising-amount-of-money-here-s-how-he-earned-it.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-weeknd-is-worth-a-surprising-amount-of-money-here-s-how-he-earned-it.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-weeknd-is-worth-a-surprising-amount-of-money-here-s-how-he-earned-it.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-weeknd-is-worth-a-surprising-amount-of-money-here-s-how-he-earned-it.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-weeknd-is-worth-a-surprising-amount-of-money-here-s-how-he-earned-it.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./vanessa-bryant-sues-over-kobe-crash-photos-everything-to-know.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./vanessa-bryant-sues-over-kobe-crash-photos-everything-to-know.html>Vanessa Bryant Sues Over Kobe Crash Photos: Everything to Know</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./shay-rudolph-net-worth-how-much-is-shay-rudolph-worth.html>Shay Rudolph Net Worth How Much Is Shay Rudolph Worth?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./shay-rudolph-net-worth-how-much-is-shay-rudolph-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
