The term “masters” refers to the original recordings of her songs, which are owned by the record label. In 2019, a highly publicized controversy arose when her original label, Big Machine Records, was sold to Scooter Braun’s company, Ithaca Holdings. This transaction resulted in Scooter Braun gaining control of Taylor’s early recordings, including her critically acclaimed albums.</p><p>“For years I asked, pleaded for a chance to own my own work. Instead, I was given an opportunity to sign back up to Big Machine Records and ‘earn’ one album back at a time, one for every new one I turned in. I walked away because I knew once I signed that contract, Scott Borchetta would sell the label, thereby selling me and my future. I had to make the excruciating choice to leave behind my past. Music I wrote on my bedroom floor and videos I dreamed up and paid for from the money I earned playing in bars, then clubs, then arenas, then stadiums.”</p><p>As a result, Taylor Swift decided to take matters into her own hands. She embarked on the ambitious task of re-recording her early albums, thus reclaiming her masters and regaining control over her music. This re-recording process involves creating new versions of her original songs, preserving the essence and spirit of the originals while imbuing them with a fresh perspective.</p><p>The re-recording process allows Taylor to not only assert ownership and control over her music but also maintain the authenticity and integrity of her artistry. It gives her the power to decide how her songs are used and shared, ensuring that her creative vision remains intact.</p><p>While re-recording an entire catalog of albums is undoubtedly a tremendous undertaking, Taylor Swift’s dedication to reclaiming her masters demonstrates her unwavering commitment to artistic control and the value she places on her art. It is a testament to her resilience and determination to protect her musical legacy, ensuring that future generations can experience her music on her terms.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/0043d976.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Taylor-Swift-re-recording-process-1024x585.jpg alt="Taylor Swift re-recording process" title="Taylor Swift re-recording process" width=1024 height=585 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Taylor Swift’s Continued Evolution</h2><p>Throughout her career, Taylor Swift has consistently evolved as an artist, showcasing her musical growth and genre exploration.
