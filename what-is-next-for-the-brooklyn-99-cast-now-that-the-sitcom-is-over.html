On the one hand, it was a great conclusion that had everything fans could want: laughter, emotional moments, and an important message. But on the other hand, it was sad for fans to say goodbye to their favorite characters forever. The whole series somehow managed to address relevant social issues without losing its comedic side, and maybe that's what made it so popular. The terrific cast most likely helped with that too.<span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Fan Theories About 'Brooklyn Nine-Nine' That Are Worth Considering</a></span>After eight amazing seasons, some of the cast has decided to take it easy for a while and keep their schedules clear. Other cast members, for their part, already have several projects lined up and are ready to move on. Here's where fans will be able to see their favorite actors next.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=andy-samberg><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Andy Samberg</span></h2><p><a href=#>Andy Samberg</a>, as most readers surely know, played the great detective Jake Peralta, a sometimes annoying and immature but otherwise charming member of the squad. Through the series, fans got to watch Jake grow up and become a great friend, husband, and father. Andy's portrayal was incredible, and now that the show is over, he plans to continue blowing everyone away with his upcoming projects. He and Maya Rudolph are set to host Peacock's new holiday baking competition, a show called Baking It. He also will be working alongside his former Saturday Night Live colleague <a href=#>John Mulaney</a> as a voiceover actor on Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=melissa-fumero><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Melissa Fumero</span></h2><p>Melissa Fumero's portrayal of Detective Amy Santiago will not be forgotten any time soon. She became one of the fans' favorites, and it will be some time until we get used to seeing her playing other characters. Fortunately, her character Melissa Tarleton, which she will play in Marvel's M.O.D.O.K. when the new season comes, has similarities to Amy Santiago.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Important Facts About Andy Samberg's Career</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"They're both really type-A kind of go-getters. So there are definitely some similarities there. I think in general, <a href=#>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</a> and Amy Santiago prepared me for many things and many other roles. I joke that I feel like I've gone to this really elite comedy school for eight years because of all the amazing people I've worked with there. I've learned so much," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she shared</a>. "So then to have something like MODOK come along, that is just as funny and operating on that same high level with the jokes, you feel prepared. You're like, 'Okay, I know how to do this,' which is a good feeling."</p><p>Melissa is also set to star on Bar Fight, a movie that will come out next year.</p><h2 id=stephanie-beatriz><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Stephanie Beatriz</span></h2><p>It's always hilarious for fans to compare <a href=#>Stephanie Beatriz</a> to her character, Rosa Diaz. Stephanie is such a sweetheart, always smiling and chatty, while Rosa, especially in the early seasons, would threaten anyone who even looked at her. As the show progressed, Rosa learned that caring about people and letting them help her was not a weakness, and she learned to see the squad as her family, which was one of the most heartwarming transformations on the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though the show is over, Stephanie has a busy schedule. She is currently working as a voiceover actor for the Netflix series Maya and the Three, will be starring in Disney's animated movie Encanto. She will also play Batwoman in the upcoming animated movie Catwoman: Hunted.</p><h2 id=andre-braugher><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Andre Braugher</span></h2><p>Andre Braugher played Captain Raymond Holt, a very progressive police captain that used his position of power to try and make a difference for the better. Much like Rosa Diaz, through the series, he learned to show his feelings and appreciate the people that care about him. And in the process, he influenced his squad for the better.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Brooklyn Nine-Nine: The Cast Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, in his new role, Andre will also be promoting a great cause. He will star in the movie She Said, based on the book by Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey She Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story That Helped Ignite a Movement. The movie will retell the investigation into sexual assault and harassment perpetrated by Harvey Weinstein that sparked the #MeToo movement.</p><h2 id=terry-crews><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Terry Crews</span></h2><p>Terry Jeffords looked like he could crush people with one hand (and he probably could), but he was probably the sweetest member of the squad. Terry Crews played his part perfectly, and now that <a href=#>Brooklyn Nine-Nine</a> ended, he has an exciting project coming. He's starring in an animated movie called Rumble, and he's thrilled about it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I did a voiceover for that a little while ago, Iâ€™ve been doing about three or four. What happens with animated movies is that you go in, do one pass on all your lines, and they animate the movie, then you keep coming back and improving it and changing it and doing all this stuff," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he explained</a>. "I did have a really big movie come out during quarantine, which was called The Willoughbyâ€™s and it was really, really good on Netflix. That was another animated film. So I just love doing those things, and Iâ€™m the bad guy. When we do stuff and Iâ€™m animated, itâ€™ll always be cool."</p><h2 id=chelsea-peretti><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Chelsea Peretti</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Most fans were very sad to see <a href=#>Chelsea Peretti</a> leave the show. Her character, Gina Linetti, was undoubtedly a great addition to the series, but the comedian is a very busy woman, and she couldn't continue working as part of the main cast. She returned for a few special episodes, and of course, she was there for the finale. Nowadays, she's working on the animated movie Sing 2, alongside superstars like Bono, Halsey, Scarlett Johansson, and many more.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>What Is 'Brooklyn Nine-Nine' Star Chelsea Peretti's Net Worth?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYra0ec2er61llqS%2FbsDHnmSbqp%2BkuK3FzWZwcmWTlsC1ec2ormasmJbBbsDHnmSsoaSYvK55yKxkqK6Vp3w%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-is-next-for-the-brooklyn-99-cast-now-that-the-sitcom-is-over.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-is-next-for-the-brooklyn-99-cast-now-that-the-sitcom-is-over.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-is-next-for-the-brooklyn-99-cast-now-that-the-sitcom-is-over.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-is-next-for-the-brooklyn-99-cast-now-that-the-sitcom-is-over.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-is-next-for-the-brooklyn-99-cast-now-that-the-sitcom-is-over.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-is-next-for-the-brooklyn-99-cast-now-that-the-sitcom-is-over.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./who-is-alejandro-villanueva-s-wife-madelyn-villanueva.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./who-is-alejandro-villanueva-s-wife-madelyn-villanueva.html>Who is Alejandro Villanuevas wife Madelyn Villanueva?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./two-years-later-jason-derulo-speaks-out-on-break-up-with-jordin-sparks.html>Two Years Later, Jason Derulo Speaks Out On Break-Up With Jordin Sparks</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./two-years-later-jason-derulo-speaks-out-on-break-up-with-jordin-sparks.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
