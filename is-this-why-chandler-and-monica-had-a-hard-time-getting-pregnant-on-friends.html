<time>01 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p>Chandler Bing and Monica Geller are an interesting match, and the characters, played by Matthew Perry and Courteney Cox, were a surprise couple on the hit sitcom&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Friends</a></strong>. Many fans think <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Monica is the most&nbsp;important&nbsp;friend</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">not every writer wanted Monica and Chandler to date</a>, the romance has been a beloved and popular one, right up there with Ross and Rachel.</p><p>While some friendships can make it through pregnancies and babies, other pals stop hanging out because they can't relate to each other anymore. Thankfully, the group on&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;stays super tight as they move forward in their lives, and eventually, Chandler and Monica&nbsp;want to have a baby. They struggle with fertility, and there's a fan theory that might explain why.</p><h2 id=the-mockolate-did-it>The Mockolate Did It?</h2><p>Fans have many theories about&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;and they are often fascinating, including&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an idea about Phoebe's legs</a>. Of course, there's really no way to know if these theories are true or not but they are enjoyable to hear about.</p><p>This <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fan theory says that Monica&nbsp;ate fake chocolate</a> and that's why she had trouble getting pregnant.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to&nbsp;Diply, Monica started working for a man named&nbsp;Mr. Rastatter and he showed her the world of&nbsp;Mockolate. It's a "chocolate substitute" that is definitely very gross and doesn't taste as good as the real thing. Monica came up with some treat ideas that used the product and it's a silly and fun storyline.</p><p>The idea is that this product wasn't actually healthy and while Monica might not have eaten a massive amount, she ate enough that it could have made her infertile.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Monica-Chandler-Friends.jpg><p>The episode in question? That would be the season two entry "The One With The List."</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The FDA didn't approve Mockolate</a> and according to&nbsp;Friends.fandom.com, it was "something&nbsp;about laboratory rats." That's why someone started wondering if this caused issues for Monica.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;fans recall, Monica and Chandler have twins via a surrogate. They hire a woman named Erica (played by Anna Faris) and she has the babies in the series finale. Everyone is&nbsp;surprised that she has twins and the couple decides to name them Erica and Jack. It's an incredibly moving scene and one that fans will never forget.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This Is How Long It Took To Film The Last Episode Of ‘Friends’</a></span></p><h2 id=monica-and-chandler>Monica And Chandler</h2><p>Whether or not fans believe in this theory, it's a funny one, and it makes fans glad that the couple was able to have twins through surrogacy. It's also interesting to take a look at their love story.</p><p>Scott Silveri, one of the writers and executive producers on&nbsp;Friends, told&nbsp;Vulture.com&nbsp;that the writers felt they had to have something going on with the show that wasn't just Rachel and Ross. Silveri told the publication that this is why Monica and Chandler ended up together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Silveri said, “The thinking was, if the show’s going to be entertaining for years to come, it can’t simply rest on this one [Ross and Rachel] relationship. So it follows that if another pair got together, that would be fun and provide more story. And it’s organic: If you get six friends together, all around the same age, there’s gonna be a little mixing and matching as time goes on. It felt real.”</p><p>Many fans of the show feel that the romance was great and what the show needed. In a&nbsp;Reddit&nbsp;thread about their love story, a fan posted, "I like Monica and Chandler because the relationship blended so naturally. They were good friends for many years including Ross's College years, and eventually evolved into something more meaningful."&nbsp;Many would agree that while it was surprising when they started dating, it was a good surprise and made the show more compelling.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Close Are ‘Friends’ Stars Matthew Perry And Matt LeBlanc Today?</a></span></p><h2 id=this-season-one-scene>This Season One&nbsp;Scene</h2><p>According to&nbsp;Express.co.uk,&nbsp;Friends made it clear from the first season that Monica would end up with twins.</p><p>Ross and his ex-wife Carol have a son named Ben, and a&nbsp;Reddit&nbsp;user realized that Monica was upset&nbsp;when he was born and she said that she wished she could have a baby, too. She said, “No fair. I don’t even have one. How come they get two?” Chandler replied, “I’ll tell you what. If we’re 40 and neither of us are married, what do you say you and I get together and have one?”</p><p>It's really sweet to think about this scene, as of course, they&nbsp;not only fall in love but raise twins together.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Aniston Gives Her Positive Take On The Delay Of The ‘Friends’ Reunion</a></span></p><p>Whether or not the fake chocolate was the reason why Monica and Chandler had trouble having a baby on&nbsp;Friends, it's a fun fan theory to hear about, and it's a nice reminder of how wonderful this TV couple is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Why Jennifer Aniston Lost Weight Before Playing Rachel On ‘Friends’</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGigrGWknba0edahsGabmJa7pbjEq2SappRiurC6yJyYZqCRmXqieceaqZ1lpJ66pnnGnqutoZ6cerG%2BxKClmqakYryvecWroJ6mlKh8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-this-why-chandler-and-monica-had-a-hard-time-getting-pregnant-on-friends.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fis-this-why-chandler-and-monica-had-a-hard-time-getting-pregnant-on-friends.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fis-this-why-chandler-and-monica-had-a-hard-time-getting-pregnant-on-friends.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fis-this-why-chandler-and-monica-had-a-hard-time-getting-pregnant-on-friends.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-this-why-chandler-and-monica-had-a-hard-time-getting-pregnant-on-friends.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-this-why-chandler-and-monica-had-a-hard-time-getting-pregnant-on-friends.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./tiktok-users-realize-the-o-c-pool-house-was-fake.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./tiktok-users-realize-the-o-c-pool-house-was-fake.html>TikTok Users Realize 'The O.C' Pool House Was Fake</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./hollywood-heavyweights-hidden-stars-actors-with-the-most-billion-dollar-movies-ranked.html>Hollywood Heavyweights, Hidden Stars: Actors With The Most Billion Dollar Movies, Ranked</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./hollywood-heavyweights-hidden-stars-actors-with-the-most-billion-dollar-movies-ranked.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
