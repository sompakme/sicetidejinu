Now, Dewan's character is engaged to the main character, and it seems like she will be a big part of the show going forward. Before joining the cast of The Rookie, Dewan was best known as the star of Step Up and previously being married to Channing Tatum.</p><p>Thanks to Dewan's acting career, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the divorce settlement she spent years fighting for</a>, the actor is The Rookie's richest cast member.

Most notably, Fillion starred in Castle, Firefly and its spin-off movie Serenity. Fillion also has a lot of film credits, including roles in movies like Slither, Waitress, Super, Monsters University, The Suicide Squad, and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given how popular Fillion has been for decades, it is surprising that the actor isn't richer.
