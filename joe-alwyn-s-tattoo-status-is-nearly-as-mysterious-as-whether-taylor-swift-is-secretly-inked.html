Swifties are clever detectives who analyze social media pages and interviews for clues and Easter eggs, and when she puts out new <strong><a href=#>music</a></strong>, they waste no time trying to guess who each song is about. Even if "Getaway Car" from "Reputation" isn't a <a href=#>song about Tom Hiddleston</a>, it's fun to imagine that it could be.</p><p>There's no doubt that several tunes off "Tortured Poets" will be added to the list of the <a href=#>singer's most popular songs</a> . After Taylor Swift released her music video for her first single "Fortnight," people did even more detective work. <a href=#>Fans thought Swift and Alwyn were engaged</a> because she had a garter on in one scene. They also noticed something else: <strong>Swift had tattoos in the video</strong>. Swift's "Fortnight" collaborator <a href=#>Post Malone has countless tattoos</a> and in one scene, Post Malone's tattoos get transferred to Swift's face, which is a fun image. This made everyone curious about Swift's tattoo status.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In this article, we'll take a look at <strong>the mystery surrounding whether Joe Alwyn and Taylor Swift have tattoos</strong>, along with a closer look at their six-year relationship.</p><h2 id=do-joe-alwyn-and-taylor-swift-have-tattoos>Do Joe Alwyn And Taylor Swift Have Tattoos?</h2><p><strong>Joe Alwyn and Taylor Swift's tattoo status is a mystery</strong> because <strong>neither singer has said they have tattoos</strong>.</p><p>According to Extra TV, there is no indication that Alwyn is tattooed.

It seems that her "Fortnight" tattoo was a temporary one, and in 2021, Swift had a back tattoo in her video for "ME!" While <a href=#>fans consider this Swift's worst song</a>, the video was cool. The singer sported a tattoo that had a snake and several butterflies. But just like the "Fortnight" video made fans wonder if Swift had a secret tattoo, it was hard not to think that the "ME!" video tattoo was real.</p><h2 id=inside-taylor-swift-and-joe-alwyn-39-s-relationship>Inside Taylor Swift And Joe Alwyn's Relationship</h2><p>While Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn's tattoo status may be mysterious, so was their six-year relationship.
