While the latter already had three albums out at the time, teaming up with Carey for their collaborative track was ultimately going to benefit both of their careers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For the mother of two, it was another No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, with sales of over four million copies worldwide, while Jay-Z nabbed himself some crossover appeal outside of the US, subsequently growing his international fanbase thanks to how popular the song had become.</p><p>Over the years, Carey, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who is worth a reported $500 million</a>, and Jay-Z have remained close friends. In fact, the self-proclaimed elusive chanteuse even shares close ties with the rapper’s wife, Beyonce, who she has often deemed as one of the most talented women she knows in the music industry.</p><p>Recently however, Carey’s friendship with Hova was put into question when it was claimed that MC had decided to leave Jay’s Roc Nation management after an intense disagreement concerning the future of her career, but what’s the truth to their supposed feud? Here’s the lowdown…</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mariah-and-jay-z-friends-or-foes>Mariah And Jay-Z: Friends or Foes?</h2><p>It’s unclear whether or not Jay and Carey were already close before their collaboration with “Heartbreaker,” but any major industry events that occurred after 1998, the two were always posing beside one another for photos and conversing alongside their mutual friends.</p><p>“Heartbreaker” also wasn’t the only time the pair had joined forces to collaborate, having also worked together on the remix version to Carey’s 2007 single “Bye Bye.” The track didn’t fare as well as their previous collab, but it was nice to see that after almost 10 years, these two were still close buddies and enjoyed working together.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Many Kids Has Nick Cannon Had Since Divorcing Mariah Carey?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Then, in November 2017, it was announced that Carey had signed a deal over at Roc Nation, who would be managing her career moving forward, which many fans considered a wonderful move for the iconic songstress.</p><p>After all the drama that came with hiring Stella Bulochnikov, Carey wanted a new team around her right before she would gear up to commence work on her next studio album — and what better way to stage her comeback with a new team appointed by music mogul Jay-Z?</p><p>“[Mariah’s] cleaning house. She is getting legitimate people, assistants, a lawyer, and Stella is not happy about it,”&nbsp;a source told Page Six at the time. “Previously, there were all kinds of people involved [in her career] and Mariah didn’t even know those people. She had to distance herself from all that and she’s now cleaning house.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s How Mariah Carey Amassed Her $520 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With the help of Roc Nation;’s management, Carey went on to release her fifteenth studio album Caution in November 2018, which remains one of the highest-rated projects she has ever released.</p><p>With the help of Roc Nation, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Carey also saw a lot of success with her Christmas song</a>, “All I Want For Christmas Is You,” which first went to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2019 — 25 years after its release.</p><p>It then went back to No. 1 the following year following an enormous promotional campaign along with an Apple TV+ special, which was said to have earned MC millions in revenue.</p><p>On top of that, Roc Nation also helped Carey secure three tours, generating tens of millions in revenue for the R&B superstar — but in June 2021, it was alleged via The Sun that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">things had turned ugly between Hova and MC</a> following a meeting about the future of Carey’s career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“She will formally depart in the next few weeks.

As for her time with Roc Nation, she stills plans on leaving but denies any drama between herself and her longtime pal.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">It Turns Out These Reality TV Shows Were Always Scripted</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikmqqZlrVur8CrnLJllqe2prrDrGSwoaSdequt2GaxZp6fp3qwwsSrZK2vn2Kxpq%2FAnZysZaKauaLAyKilrKCZpXq1u8OasGg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmariah-carey-has-been-friends-with-jay-z-for-over-two-decades-but-are-they-still-close.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmariah-carey-has-been-friends-with-jay-z-for-over-two-decades-but-are-they-still-close.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmariah-carey-has-been-friends-with-jay-z-for-over-two-decades-but-are-they-still-close.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmariah-carey-has-been-friends-with-jay-z-for-over-two-decades-but-are-they-still-close.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmariah-carey-has-been-friends-with-jay-z-for-over-two-decades-but-are-they-still-close.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmariah-carey-has-been-friends-with-jay-z-for-over-two-decades-but-are-they-still-close.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./rhoslc-s-heather-gay-reveals-how-jen-shah-gave-her-black-eye.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./rhoslc-s-heather-gay-reveals-how-jen-shah-gave-her-black-eye.html>RHOSLC's Heather Gay Reveals How Jen Shah Gave Her Black Eye</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./mamadou-diallo-columbus-ohio-48-year-old-charged-with-fatoumata-diallo-murder.html>Mamadou Diallo Columbus Ohio | 48 Year Old Charged With Fatoumata Diallo Murder</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./mamadou-diallo-columbus-ohio-48-year-old-charged-with-fatoumata-diallo-murder.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
