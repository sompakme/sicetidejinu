But which has been more lucrative for the actor?</span><p>Sheldon often tells stories about his late father using his mother’s china for target practice and shooting the television screen because his football team lost. He also explains that his father has an affair, yet on Young Sheldon, George only flirts with a neighbor and appears a loving father. George has already passed by the time The Bang Bang Theory story begins, so he is only mentioned as a memory by his widow and children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sheldon's mother, Mary, was the first member of the Cooper family to be introduced in The Big Bang Theory. She appears throughout the 12 seasons, acting judgmentally and very god-fearing. The younger and older Mary are very similar, although the Young Sheldon version is much more mellow.</p><p>Sheldon's twin, <a href=#>Missy, is a fan-favorite character</a> on Young Sheldon but only appears twice on The Big Bang Theory. As a child, she wasn't as academically intelligent as her brother, but she was wise and good at reading people and making friends. Fans were surprised to see she had to become a successful adult when she appeared as Amy and Sheldon's wedding. Georgie is the least seen member of the Cooper family, not appearing until season 11 of TBBT. Although his entrepreneurial nature can be displayed in the younger version.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdqLWmuMOopWabn6S9pr6Mn5imoZyuerOxy5qroqeeqHqjtcZmmZqml2LBqbHOq7BmrJWjwKZ52Kisp59dqLWmuMOopWg%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fyoung-sheldon-finally-highlights-why-sheldon-s-relationship-with-his-family-is-tense-in-the-big-bang.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fyoung-sheldon-finally-highlights-why-sheldon-s-relationship-with-his-family-is-tense-in-the-big-bang.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fyoung-sheldon-finally-highlights-why-sheldon-s-relationship-with-his-family-is-tense-in-the-big-bang.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fyoung-sheldon-finally-highlights-why-sheldon-s-relationship-with-his-family-is-tense-in-the-big-bang.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fyoung-sheldon-finally-highlights-why-sheldon-s-relationship-with-his-family-is-tense-in-the-big-bang.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fyoung-sheldon-finally-highlights-why-sheldon-s-relationship-with-his-family-is-tense-in-the-big-bang.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./10-of-camila-cabello-s-most-expensive-outfits.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./10-of-camila-cabello-s-most-expensive-outfits.html>10 Of Camila Cabellos Most Expensive Outfits</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./tracee-ellis-ross-and-diana-ross-statement-lip-eye-makeup-pic.html>Tracee Ellis Ross and Diana Ross' Statement Lip, Eye Makeup: Pic</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./tracee-ellis-ross-and-diana-ross-statement-lip-eye-makeup-pic.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
