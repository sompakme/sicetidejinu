Instead, people were a lot more interested in the fact that Jelly Roll told Mongeau that <strong>he bailed on meeting Sean "Diddy" Combs</strong>.</p><p>"This is the first time in my career, ever, where they said, 'Do you want to meet such-and-such?' And I said, 'Yeah,' and I started walking that way, and as I was getting down the hallway — this is a true story — I said, 'Nah,' and went and got back in the car."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/jelly-roll-1.jpg><p>As Jelly Roll explained during his podcast appearance, he got the chance to meet Diddy when they appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! the same day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong><a href=#>Which stars wanted nothing to do with Diddy</a>, according to The Things?</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Aubrey O'Day</strong></li><li><strong>50 Cent</strong></li><li><strong>Drake</strong></li><li><strong>Danity Kane</strong></li><li><strong>Jay-Z</strong></li><li><strong>Eminem</strong></li><li><strong>Kanye West</strong></li><li><strong>The Recording Academy</strong></li><li><strong>Cassie Ventura</strong></li><li><strong>Wendy Williams</strong></li></ul><p>After Jelly Roll told Mongeau that he refused to meet Diddy, he began to try to explain the reasoning behind his decision.

I was like, 'Who don't wanna meet the guy that got Tupac killed?' And nobody thought that was funny. So, I was like, 'Oh, that's a bomb.

Jelly Roll sadly has regrets about some photos of him that were taken in situations like that.</p><p>"Because, I've been in situations where, and I won't say this stuff, where I've, like, ended up in pictures with people I didn't want to be with. Just like, just because, you know, motherf**kers will walk a carpet around the same time and s**t happens. And they be like, 'Hey, y'all get together.
