According to E!

Grant had recorded Collins confessing to doing horrifying things during a counseling session.</p><p>The tape was later leaked to TMZ. Collins believed his then-wife Faye Grant released the tape - something she denies. According to TMZ, Mark Vincent Kaplan, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Collins' lawyer, stated Grant was using the recording to get money from Collins.</a> "Faye has repeatedly threatened to give this audiotape to the media, unless Stephen agreed to pay her millions of dollars more than to which she was legally entitled."</p><p>"It appears that she has finally found an audience for this tape.

When Stephen Collins and Faye Grant were going through their messy divorce, one of the issues raised and fought over was how assets would be split between them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to People, Collins' lawyers claimed that because Grant had recorded Collins' confession, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she had also given up her right to receive any money from him</a>. "The recording was made by Faye solely to benefit herself, and she did not have any altruistic motives at all."</p><p>"This was evident in her emails to Stephen immediately after Stephen left the family residence, as she sent a series of emails asking him to pay what she was requesting so as to preclude her from 'taking him to the cleaners.'"</p><p>Collins' lawyer also wanted to prove that Grant was reason the tape was released to the press. "While Faye might be confident that because no photograph exists of her handing the recording to the receptionist at TMZ, she therefore can say she didn't give the recording to TMZ, she certainly shouldn't be found without responsibility for maintaining the custodial privacy of her copies of the recording in a way to assure they wouldn't get into the public domain."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to a different People article, Collins stated in court papers that he shouldn't have to pay Grant $13,000 to support her, "as a result of the unlawful recording that was disseminated to the media."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's What The Disgraced Dad From 7th Heaven, Stephen Collins, Is Doing Now</a></span></p><p>Grant's statement to ABC News denied she released the recording to the press. "Stephen's statements about me are false and appear to be an attempt by him to deflect from his conduct. I sincerely hope Stephen gets the help he needs."</p><p>The two finally finalized their divorce in 2015. According to E! News, "Neither ex has been awarded spousal support".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqrZ2gnbKvecKoo6Whnqh6pbXVqKmcnV2strW0jJ6vZq%2BZm7JussCynGafopa7tXnDnquaoZyofA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fstephen-collins-went-through-a-messy-divorce-with-ex-wife-faye-grant-after-the-disturbing-allegation.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fstephen-collins-went-through-a-messy-divorce-with-ex-wife-faye-grant-after-the-disturbing-allegation.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fstephen-collins-went-through-a-messy-divorce-with-ex-wife-faye-grant-after-the-disturbing-allegation.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fstephen-collins-went-through-a-messy-divorce-with-ex-wife-faye-grant-after-the-disturbing-allegation.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fstephen-collins-went-through-a-messy-divorce-with-ex-wife-faye-grant-after-the-disturbing-allegation.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fstephen-collins-went-through-a-messy-divorce-with-ex-wife-faye-grant-after-the-disturbing-allegation.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./styles-p-net-worth-therichest.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./styles-p-net-worth-therichest.html>Styles P Net Worth | TheRichest</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./richard-lefrak-net-worth-therichest.html>Richard LeFrak Net Worth | TheRichest</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./richard-lefrak-net-worth-therichest.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
