With a string of chart-topping songs, hit movies, and immense star power behind her, Jennifer sometimes seems like a force from another planet. It’s easy to forget that she’s a New York-born girl with a family of her own.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lopez was born in 1969 in Castle Hill, New York, the middle of three sisters born to David Lopez and Guadalupe Rodriguez—the latter of which is said to be <a href=#>approving of Jennifer’s relationship with Ben Affleck</a>, whom she married in 2022 after a breakup that occurred nearly 20 years earlier.</p><p>Jennifer’s older sister is Leslie Scholl, and her younger sister is Lynda Lopez. Though the two aren’t quite as well-known as their superstar sister, we have managed to unearth some details about the other Lopez girls, and how they feel about middle sister Jen.</p><h2 id=who-is-leslie-scholl>Who Is Leslie Scholl?</h2><p>Leslie Scholl shares Jennifer’s talent for music and works as a music teacher at a charter school in the Bronx.</p><p>Grazia reports that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Leslie prefers to stay out of the spotlight</a>, however, she does occasionally appear in photos with her superstar little sister. In a post shared to Instagram by the youngest Lopez sister Lynda, Leslie could be seen blowing out her birthday candles with Jennifer by her side.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Jennifer Lopez Finally Lost It On The Paparazzi After This</a></span></p><p>According to Hollywood Life, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Leslie has dipped her toes in the world of movies</a>, playing an opera singer in the 2021 film The Man in the Attic. She also appeared alongside Jennifer and youngest sister Leslie, and her child Brendan, in the 2020 short Draw With Me.</p><p>Leslie has two children, Steven and Brendan, and Jennifer sometimes shouts out to them on social media. In 2017, she praised Brendan for being selected to represent their school as the Global Young Leaders Conference in Washington D.C.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I couldn’t be more proud!” Jennifer wrote in the caption of a post of Brendan. “Brendan is strong and smart and loving and obviously a leader!! Titi Jenn loves you.”</p><h2 id=who-is-lynda-lopez>Who Is Lynda Lopez?</h2><p>Lynda Lopez was born in 1971. Like her sisters, Lynda is talented in the arts and has worked as a journalist, author, radio presenter, and producer. She tends to appear in the spotlight more than oldest sister Leslie, and co-founded Nuyorican Productions, which is responsible for films like Hustlers (which starred Jennifer) and Apocalypse of Ice.</p><p>Lynda is best-known for appearing as an anchor and co-anchor on Fox 5 Live, ABC, and Good Day New York. Like Jennifer, she has also won her share of accolades for her work, including a Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Morning News Program in 2001. She has also worked as a VJ on MTV.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Which Jennifer Lopez Rom Com Was The Biggest Box-Office Hit?</a></span></p><p>Recently, Lynda edited an essay collection called AOC: The Fearless Rise and Powerful Resonance of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, which features several writers.</p><p>Occasionally, Lynda accompanies Jennifer to red-carpet events or on tour.</p><h2 id=is-jennifer-lopez-close-with-her-sisters>Is Jennifer Lopez Close With Her Sisters?</h2><p>Though Leslie Lopez tends to stay out of the spotlight and Lynda Lopez is famous by her own merits, the two have occasionally spoken about Jennifer and their relationship with her. Judging from their comments, and from what Jennifer has said over the years, the three sisters are close.</p><p>In a 2002 interview that Jennifer did with Oprah, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Leslie and Lynda appeared in footage that showed them gushing about their sister</a> and reminiscing on their childhood memories of her.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Facts About Jennifer Lopez We Almost Forgot</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“As a kid, Jen was the ringleader,” Leslie recalled. “Anything that was concocted was usually her idea.” The oldest Lopez then shared that she still views Jennifer as her “little pain in the butt sister.”</p><p>“She's always my sister,” she said. “She's a famous movie star to all of you, but not to me. She's still my sister.”</p><p>Lynda shared a similar sentiment, confessing that it was hard for her to wrap her head around her big sister’s stardom.</p><p>“I don't why it makes me laugh, I'm like 'All these people are here to see my goofball sister,’” Lynda recalled. “It's the only thought that goes through your head. It's like, I can't believe these are people that are here to see, Jen, my goofy sister who ran around in her underwear in our house when we were little.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Cheat Sheet, Jennifer confirmed that she is close with her sisters in a 2014 interview with HuffPost Live, but she considers Lynda to be her best friend:</p><p>“We've always been close.
