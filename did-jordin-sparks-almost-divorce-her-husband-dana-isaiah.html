From her breakup with Jason Derulo years ago to her whirlwind relationship with <a href=#>husband Dana Isaiah</a>, people want to know what's happening in Sparks' love life.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's Why Ben Stiller And Wife Christine Taylor Almost Divorced</a></span></p><p>However, one thing American Idol alum, Jordin Sparks, can't be accused of, is being an unsupportive wife.</p><p>Sparks was quick to defend her man after fans heavily criticized him for posting a picture of him and another woman. They deemed the picture inappropriate for a married man, despite the woman being his friend.</p><p>Fortunately, the incident didn't cause marital strife between the lovebirds.</p><h2 id=fans-accused-dana-of-inappropriate-behavior>Fans Accused Dana Of Inappropriate Behavior</h2><p>Actress and singer, Jordin Sparks, was only 17 years old when she won the sixth season of American Idol.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After that, she shot to stardom and has steadily built her career over the years. It's safe to say that <a href=#>she's attained unimaginable success since American Idol</a>.</p><p>With success came fame—Jordin was thrust into the spotlight. Her love life became just as talked about as her career. In 2017, the singer married model Dana Isaiah in a secret ceremony in Hawaii.</p><p>In 2019, the pair made headlines when Dana shared a picture on his Instagram account of him cozied up to another woman. The woman happened to be his high school classmate, but fans weren't having it.</p><p>The since-deleted post featured a picture of Dana with a woman who had her arm draped over his shoulder while the two smiled at the camera.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He captioned the picture, "Not very many people can… 1). Get me out of the house past 10:30. 2). Get me to smile this big. 3). Have me talking about high school. Shoutout to a real one."</p><h2 id=sparks-stood-by-her-man>Sparks Stood By Her Man</h2><p>Fans also questioned Jordin's absence from the outing, if the friendship was innocent.</p><p>However, Jordin didn't agree with them; she came to her husband's defense and spoke about the importance of friendship.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>A Certain Quote From Joel Osteen May Have Sparked Divorce Rumors</a></span></p><p>The star responded under her husband's post, even telling Dana and the woman that she loves them both and praised their friendship.</p><p>"Y’all. Here’s a message: if your significant other is making you cut off your really good, stand up, been there since forever friends, male or female…GET OUT. (Not talking about the friends that are toxic/frenemies, that’s a problem and should be addressed.) That’s controlling/toxic, and people are NOT objects you own."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She continued, "Again, people are NOT OBJECTS YOU OWN. Friends are super important for your well-being, especially those that knew you before certain huge life changes happen. It’s HEALTHY."</p><p>Jordin summed up by writing, "I hope you all find someone that treats you like my husband and his friends do. They are truly the best. May the odds be ever in your favor…Awww I love you both! She’s such a treasure!"</p><h2 id=dana-stirred-rumors-of-a-split-with-another-post>Dana Stirred Rumors Of A Split With Another Post</h2><p>In 2020, another one of Dana's social media posts had tongues wagging. He took to Twitter to share a cryptic message that left fans speculating about the status of his marriage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just like the picture that earned him criticism from fans the year before, the tweet was later deleted too.</p><p>Before it was deleted, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shade Room captured a screen grab of the post,</a> which they later shared on Instagram.</p><p>The Tweet read, "You can't force someone to stay married to you," the tweet read. "Especially after you made them look like a fool publicly twice. God ain't in that."</p><p>Once again, fans had a lot to say about the couple, and Dana headed back to Twitter to clear the air. He shared a Tweet that seemed like a response to the chatter that surrounded his previous post.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Trust me when I say this. If me and my wife were having issues… NONE OF YALL WOULD KNOW. Lol."</p><p>Jordin also posted a picture with her husband and son, perhaps to put the rumors and speculations to rest.</p><h2 id=they-39-re-still-going-strong>They're Still Going Strong</h2><p>If their social media posts are anything to go by, Jordin and Dana have a solid bond. The pair often share pictures of their cute family to their respective Instagram accounts.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Which 'Marrying Millions' Couples Are Still Together?</a></span></p><p>The lovebirds have been married for four years now and have an adorable son together. Their love story, including <a href=#>the tale of how they met</a>, sounds too good to be true.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Which is maybe why fans speculate so much over the couple's marriage. After all, not every celebrity winds up in a marriage that lasts, though Jordin seems to be well on her way.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Snooki And Tori Spelling Stay Positive Amid Divorce Rumors</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibmqaRYra0rcian2ain6exqrqMrKeaqpuoeqnB0puYp5xdmba3u9GcnGabmJqutbXNoGSrrZ2kv3A%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-jordin-sparks-almost-divorce-her-husband-dana-isaiah.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdid-jordin-sparks-almost-divorce-her-husband-dana-isaiah.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdid-jordin-sparks-almost-divorce-her-husband-dana-isaiah.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdid-jordin-sparks-almost-divorce-her-husband-dana-isaiah.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-jordin-sparks-almost-divorce-her-husband-dana-isaiah.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-jordin-sparks-almost-divorce-her-husband-dana-isaiah.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./dog-the-bounty-hunter-i-just-discovered-i-have-a-son-named-jon.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./dog-the-bounty-hunter-i-just-discovered-i-have-a-son-named-jon.html>Dog the Bounty Hunter: I Just 'Discovered' I Have a Son Named Jon</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./britney-spears-reportedly-wants-another-baby-amid-divorce-after-her-sons-move-away.html>Britney Spears Reportedly Wants Another Baby Amid Divorce After Her Sons Move Away</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./britney-spears-reportedly-wants-another-baby-amid-divorce-after-her-sons-move-away.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
