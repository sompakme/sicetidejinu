He is an actor and singer, best-known for his role as Frisco Jones in the drama General Hospital.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Peter John Wagner II, A Multi-Talented Star</h2><p>Peter John Wagner II was born on October 3, 1959 in Washington, Missouri. His family was deeply religious, and he was reared as a devout Catholic.</p><p>Wagner was a music enthusiast as a child&nbsp; and his love for music increased day by day. He’d been playing guitar since he was 14 years old.</p><p>He went to St. Gertrude’s parochial school for his studies and he later enrolled into St. Francis Borgia Regional High School where he completed his education.</p><p>Wagner was so much into sports, so when he was in school, he participated in many sports such as basketball and football.</p><p>He spent a year at the University of Missouri, then went to&nbsp; junior college. Then he transferred to the University of Arizona. He tried out for the golf team and theater department while being a student.</p><p>John Wagner hit the jackpot when his university’s theater department granted him a full scholarship. Then, he graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree.</p><p>He has acquired significant acclaim not just as an exceptional stage actor and singer, but also as a scratch golfer. He has won six club titles at his home course in Los Angeles, The BelAir Country Club.</p><p>Wagner has also won the American Century Celebrity Golf Championship twice. Wagner topped the tournament for the first time in 2006.</p><p>He returned as the winner in 2011, defeating Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo. He’s finished in the top 10 nineteen times.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>In his Professional Life</h2><p>In 1982, he made his acting debut as Clint Masterson in the short-lived TV soap opera A New Day In Eden.</p><p>Wagner’s most well-known character was Frisco Jones on General Hospital from 1983 to 1988, 1989 to 1991, and 1994 to 1995. Wagner was expected to return to GH in February 2013 also.</p><p>He made his name with Kristina Wagner, who played Felicia in the soap opera, and the on-screen couple became a power couple.</p><p>Playing rocker Frisco Jones in General Hospital led him to sing songs for the soap opera, which prompted a multi-album partnership with Quincy Jones’ Warner Bros.</p><p>Wagner also starred as Warren Lockridge in Santa Barbara from 1991 until the show’s end in 1993. He starred in many made-for-TV movies, such as Moving Target, Lady Killer, Frequent Flyer, and Dirty Little Secret.</p><p>He starred as Nick Marone on the CBS daytime drama The Bold and the Beautiful from 2003 until 2012.&nbsp;</p><p>Wagner received a Daytime Emmy award for “Best Younger Actor” for his role in the soap opera General Hospital in 1985.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2005, John was also nominated for “Best Lead Actor” for his role in The Bold and the Beautiful.</p><p>Wagner participated in season 14 of Dancing with the Stars in 2012, partnering with professional dancer Anna Trebunskaya. On April 3, 2012, they were ousted from the contest, finishing 11th.</p><p>Wagner, in addition to his acting profession, is a rock/pop singer/musician who performed on live concerts in the 1980s. However, he has six studio albums to his credit.</p><p>When it comes to music, John Wagner has made his imprint just as much as he has in the realm of the drama industry.</p><p>With the song “All I Need,” Wagner hit the Billboard charts in 1985. The record peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the Adult Contemporary chart.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Net Worth</h2><p>Jack Wagner’s net worth is estimated to be around $9.8 million , according to Celebrity Net Worth.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Relationship and Children</h2><p>John Wagner and Kristina Wagner, who portrayed his soul mate Felicia Cummings on General Hospital, were dating before they were cast.</p><p>Kristina and Jack’s <a href=#>relationship</a> was publicly disclosed in 1990. It was around this time that Kristina was pregnant for the first time with son, Peter.&nbsp;</p><p>They tied a knot at Lake Tahoe in 1993 at a small wedding chapel. Despite the fact that Kristina and Jack had their second son, Harrison, in 1995, their 13-year relationship was fraught with difficulties.</p><p>The couple called it quits and filed for a divorce after experiencing irreconcilable disagreements, and it was confirmed in 2006.</p><p>However, the ex-couple, Wagners, have two children together. Harrison was born in 1994 and Peter was born in 1990. In 2011, he also reconnected with his biological daughter Kerry at a concert.</p><p>Mother of Kerry had put her up for adoption when she was born, so she went in search of her original parents.</p><p>In 2007, Wagner fell in love and started dating Heather Locklear from Melrose Place. The couple also got engaged in August 2011. On November 15, 2011, the pair decided to break off their engagement.</p><p>He also revealed to Soaps In Depth in May 2013 that he and his former co-star, Ashley Jones from The Bold and the Beautiful were in a relationship for a year. But the duo called it quits in 2015.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Harrison Jack Wagner Passed Away at the Age of 27</h2><p>The son of John Wagner and Kristina Wagner, Harrison Wagner was found dead in a parking lot of Los Angeles on June 6, 2022 and the news has come as a shock to everyone.</p><p>Initially, the investigative team was looking for the cause of his death; however, it was subsequently discovered that they suspect a drug overdose but the exact cause is still unknown.</p><p>When Harrison Wagner suddenly disappeared for over a week in 2016, Jack Wagner opened up regarding his youngest son’s battle with drug abuse.</p><p>“I fear for my youngest son’s safety,”&nbsp; Jack stated at the time.</p><p>“Harrison has struggled with drugs and alcohol just as I did when I was younger. He’s relapsed and is MIA for five days,” said Jack.</p><p>The two brothers posed for a photo on Peter’s Instagram a few weeks before Harrison’s tragedy. And two weeks ago, Harrison shared his picture on his Instagram account with a caption:</p><p><strong>“Focus. YOU are left with YOU and your thoughts.”</strong></p><p>He usually posted his pictures on IG account with motivational and positive captions. Who’d have guessed he was having underlying problems?</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC2wJyiZq%2BRnLumvo4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-jack-wagner-is-finally-getting-into-his-stride.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fhow-jack-wagner-is-finally-getting-into-his-stride.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fhow-jack-wagner-is-finally-getting-into-his-stride.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fhow-jack-wagner-is-finally-getting-into-his-stride.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-jack-wagner-is-finally-getting-into-his-stride.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-jack-wagner-is-finally-getting-into-his-stride.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./how-much-money-did-gotye-really-make-from-somebody-that-i-used-to-know-here-s-the-truth-about-the.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./how-much-money-did-gotye-really-make-from-somebody-that-i-used-to-know-here-s-the-truth-about-the.html>How Much Money Did Gotye Really Make From 'Somebody That I Used To Know'?
