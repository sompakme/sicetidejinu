The insider’s recent comments seem to imply Britney is no longer seeing him and may be single – that is, until she finds a “sperm donor,” should the source’s claims prove true.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Britney and Paul are definitely together,” a source said of Britney and Richard in February. “He’s still in the picture.”</p><p>It seems that the couple is making efforts to maintain a low profile regarding their relationship, likely in response to the controversy that ensued last year when their romance initially garnered attention.</p><p>“She doesn’t like it when he leaves,” another source added, noting that Soliz has children of his own. “[Britney] feels as though she deserves more attention, but he has to be there for his kids.”</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/what-happened-between-britney-spears-and-selena-gomez_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="What Happened Between Britney Spears And Selena Gomez?">What Happened Between Britney Spears And Selena Gomez?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Although Gomez was a guest at Spears' wedding, many believed Spears shaded the singer on Instagram.</p><p>While formal outings are rare for them, the couple were said to take a lot of road trips to Santa Barbara, and Soliz purportedly spends two to three nights weekly at her home, according to the source.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite reportedly not seeing her sons shared with ex-husband Kevin Federline in over a year (not even before they moved to Hawaii), Britney has allegedly met her boyfriend's children and shares a good rapport with them.</p><p>Nonetheless, according to the same report, Britney's management team reportedly disapproves of their relationship, citing concerns about Soliz's criminal record, which comprises several felonies and misdemeanors. However, it seems that the Crossroads star is not heeding their advice.</p><p>“Her assistants don’t want [Paul] around; they’ve made that clear from day one,” the second source went on. “She is such a sweetheart and generous by nature, but he doesn’t want anything. He isn’t in it for that and genuinely cares about her as a person. [But] her managerial team probably thinks he is out to do something shady.”</p><p>Britney has not responded to rumors that she wants to have another baby through a sperm donor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZq6Gko7K6edKpnJqqo2LEorrTrGSapp%2Bptaa%2BjJuYm7FdlrqqsIydoK%2Bnopiybr%2FOp6pmpZ%2Brsm6t1pqwaA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbritney-spears-reportedly-wants-another-baby-amid-divorce-after-her-sons-move-away.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbritney-spears-reportedly-wants-another-baby-amid-divorce-after-her-sons-move-away.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbritney-spears-reportedly-wants-another-baby-amid-divorce-after-her-sons-move-away.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbritney-spears-reportedly-wants-another-baby-amid-divorce-after-her-sons-move-away.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbritney-spears-reportedly-wants-another-baby-amid-divorce-after-her-sons-move-away.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbritney-spears-reportedly-wants-another-baby-amid-divorce-after-her-sons-move-away.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./did-jordin-sparks-almost-divorce-her-husband-dana-isaiah.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./did-jordin-sparks-almost-divorce-her-husband-dana-isaiah.html>Did Jordin Sparks Almost Divorce Her Husband Dana Isaiah?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ann-druyan-biography-age-family-education-carl-sagan-quotes-books-and-net-worth.html>Ann Druyan Biography, Age, Family, Education, Carl Sagan, Quotes, Books And Net Worth</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ann-druyan-biography-age-family-education-carl-sagan-quotes-books-and-net-worth.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
