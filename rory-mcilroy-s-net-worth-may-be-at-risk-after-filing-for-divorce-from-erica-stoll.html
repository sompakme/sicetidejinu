Although McIlroy hails from the Ireland, the family currently lives in Jupiter, Florida, as noted by the US Sun. According to the Associated Press, the divorce filings shared that <strong>the former couple’s marriage was “irretrievably broken.”</strong> Furthermore, McIlroy’s legal team is adamant that <strong>the prenuptial agreement that both McIlroy and Stoll signed back in 2017</strong> be put into force.

In 2012, Stoll worked for the PGA of America. During that year's Ryder Cup, Stoll and McIlroy met when he realized he set his alarm in the wrong timezone and was late for his match. Stoll was able to get McIlroy to his match on time after setting up a private police escort.

Golfweek shared how thrilled McIlroy was to welcome his daughter.</p><p>"It's a private matter, but we're really excited and can't wait for her to get here."</p><p>Over the years, Stoll and Poppy have cheered on McIlroy and are his greatest supporters.

In 2013, <strong>McIlroy was engaged to tennis star Caroline Wozniacki.</strong> As professional athletes, the couple was beloved by sports fans. Unfortunately, a year later, <strong>McIlroy called off the engagement</strong> after the wedding invitations were already sent out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>US Magazine shared McIlroy's statement regarding calling off the wedding and ending his relationship.</p><p>"The problem is mine.

I wish Caroline all the happiness she deserves and thank her for the great times we've had."</p><p>When all the dust settled, Wozniacki shared on In Depth with Graham Bensinger what happened and how the breakup affected her. "I was shocked. I thought at least it would be face-to-face or something," she said. "But there was nothing. It was a phone call and I didn't hear from him again."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Partner</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Years</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Outcome</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Caroline Wozinacki</p></td><td><p>4 years together</p></td><td><p>Broken engagement</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Erica Stoll</p></td><td><p>7 years married</p></td><td><p>Pending divorce, according to TMZ</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Ending an engagement so publicly practically prepared McIlroy for announcing his divorce.
