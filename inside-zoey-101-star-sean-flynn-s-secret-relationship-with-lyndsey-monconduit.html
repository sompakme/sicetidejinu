Looking at pictures of him now, fans of the show might not be able to tell who he portrayed unless they already knew the actor's real name. He played Chase Matthews, one of the main characters on the show, and one of the most popular. He's completely grown up and looks like a different person.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After his time on 'Zoey 101' was up, Sean basically disappeared from the limelight. He's appeared in some films but overall has left acting to focus on his personal life. Since 2014, Sean's really had something come up in his personal life when he fell in love with a woman named Lyndsey Monconduit. No, the love of his life wasn't Jamie Lynn Spears, the titular character of the show <a href=#>many fans would hope</a> he would get with.</p><p>Fans of Sean have tried to play detective and figure out everything about Lyndsey and Sean's relationship, but they've left it completely out of the public's eye. Years later, the couple are happily married. How did they meet, and what's happened since then? Here's everything to know.</p><h2 id=everything-to-know-about-zoey-101-39-s-sean-flynn-a-k-a-chase-matthews>Everything To Know About Zoey 101's Sean Flynn, A.K.A. Chase Matthews</h2><p>Sean played Chase Matthews on the show. A love interest to a lot of the female characters, Chase had cultivated a large internal fan base among the show's general audience. Sean left the show at the end of season 3, showing up at times in season 4, including the finale.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In many interviews Sean's had since leaving the show, he hasn't spoken negatively about his time working on Nickelodeon. The reason he left the show was so that he could focus on his education. A hard choice to make, but that was the decision he made nonetheless. 'Zoey 101' ended a season after he left, so maybe it was a wise thing to do. The show ended because, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Jamie Lynn Spears</a>, the show had "run its course". That goes against the popular belief that the show ended because Jamie had gotten pregnant.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Sean Flynn Ruin His Career After Leaving 'Zoey 101'?</a></span></p><p>A neat fun fact about Sean is that he is actually the grandson of Errol Flynn, a famous actor from the 1930s. He also has many Jewish family members in his family. He had a rabbi officiate his wedding, and invited some family members from Israel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since Sean left 'Zoey 101', he's completed his education. He's continued to act and work on films, primarily as a producer. He worked at a company called Donatello Arm, which experiments with revolutionary film technology such as 360-degree cameras.</p><h2 id=everything-to-know-about-sean-flynn-39-s-relationship-with-lyndsey-monconduit>Everything To Know About Sean Flynn's Relationship With Lyndsey Monconduit</h2><p>Aside from his work as a producer, he's also played matchmaker for himself and won.</p><p>Well, he didn't match make himself - Tinder did. That's right, Sean met Lyndsey over the popular dating app Tinder. According to TMZ, the couple met on the app in 2014 when they both lived in Los Angeles. After some time in Los Angeles together, they moved to Georgia, and have been living there since.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Lyndsey herself is from the New Orleans family, along with most of her family. She, too, has a career in filmmaking, but she's not an actress. She actually works on art department-related things, such as set and costume design. Movies she's worked on include 2022's 'The Valet' and 2021's 'Respect'.</p><p>Their marriage was in March 2022. According to Daily Mail, they had 158 guests show up for the event. As mentioned earlier, guests hailed from Israel, and they also invited guests from the NOLA area. Of course, some of Sean's 'Zoey 101' cast mates showed up to the occasion as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-has-the-rest-of-the-zoey-101-cast-been-up-to>What Has The Rest Of The Zoey 101 Cast Been Up To?</h2><p>Sean isn't the only young cast member of 'Zoey 101'.
