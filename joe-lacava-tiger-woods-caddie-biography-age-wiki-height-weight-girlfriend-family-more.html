But, as Freddie retired, he asked Lacava to go with the talented youngsters and get another bag. Fortunately, Joe was introduced to Tiger Woods by his common friend and it turned out to be an advantage to both of them.</p><p>Born in the year 1955, Joe Lacava will be 67 years old. Joe is tall and his height measures 5 feet 9 inches while his weight is 70 kg approximately. Even at this age he appears to be fit and has a body figure measurement of 40-32-33.</p><p>Joe’s biceps measure 12.5 inches and he wears number 10 in the shoe size. Lacava is bald and has brown-colored eyes.</p><p>Renowned as the Caddie of popular golfer Tiger Woods, Joe Lacava has been with Tiger during his major wins at tournaments. He has been with the popular golfer for a long time and has not worked with any other golfer till now.</p><p>Lacava has earned most of his wealth from his work as Caddie for Mr. Woods. The total net worth estimated for Joe Lacava is between $300 thousand $500 thousand US dollars as of now.</p><p>The native of Connecticut, Joe Lacava was born and raised in Newtown, Connecticut, USA. Joe has kept the details of his family a secret and has not shared anything about his parents or siblings. Lacava attended his local high school in Connecticut but it is not known if he attended any college.</p><table width=607><tbody readability=11><tr><td></td><td width=448></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Nickname</td><td width=448>The Dolan Twins and E-tee-wee-tee</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Birth Place</td><td width=448>Newtown, Connecticut, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td width=448>1955</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td width=448>-1 Years</td></tr><tr readability=3><td>Height</td><td width=448 readability=5>In Centimetres – 176 cm<p>In Feet and Inches – 5′ 9″</p></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Weight</td><td width=448>In Kilograms – 70 Kg<br>In Pounds – 154 lbs</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Color</td><td width=448>Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td width=448>Bald</td></tr><tr readability=6><td>Profession</td><td width=448>Vlogger, Internet Personality, Instagram Star, Social Media Sensation, and Youtuber</td></tr><tr><td>Sexual Orientation</td><td width=448>Straight</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>School</td><td width=448>High School in Connecticut</td></tr><tr><td>College</td><td width=448>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td>Religion</td><td width=448>Christianity</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td width=448>American</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Home Town</td><td width=448>Newtown, Connecticut, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Fathers Name</td><td width=448>Name Not Known</td></tr><tr><td>Mothers Name</td><td width=448>Name Not Known</td></tr><tr><td>Brothers</td><td width=448>Not Known</td></tr><tr><td>Sister</td><td width=448>Not Known</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Steve Williams was originally the former Caddie of Woods and since 2011, Joe had been together with the golf player. Joe advised Woods to have a shot on the green side at the recent Master Tournament, and the outcome changed the entire game. Mr. Woods made a two-shot swing and positioned his tee shot.</p><p>LaCava stepped in to fix the problem when one of the hecklers was attempting to distract Woods during his final round of WGC-Bridgestone and supposedly asked a heckler to avoid distracting him. But Heckler said, “If you give me $25, which I paid for today’s ticket, I’ll leave now.”</p><p>Joe had his money in this crucial situation to make the Heckler leave and the issue was thus solved. He gave LaCava an option to go with another player and stay with them in another scenario when the Champion golfer realized he was going for extended recovery, or to return back if the player was not suitable with his working style. The Caddie, however, did not, even momentarily, go with another player.</p><p>Joe is married to Megan, and the couple is the parents of two children, their daughter Lauren and their son Joe. His son is now graduating from James Madison University and before that at Pomperaug High School, he was a soccer player.</p><table width=604><tbody readability=1><tr><td>Girlfriend</td><td
