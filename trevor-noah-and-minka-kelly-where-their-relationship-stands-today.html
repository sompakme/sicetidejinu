While his takeover wasn’t well-received at first, it was only a matter of time before he slowly warmed his way into the hearts of Americans. He’s since brushed shoulders with the high and mighty, including music’s first couple Beyonce and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jay-Z</a>. <strong>Minka Kell</strong>y, on the other hand, is an accomplished actress, with a career that’s strongly approaching the neighborhood of two decades. With shows like <strong>Friday Night Lights</strong>, <strong>Parenthood</strong>, and <strong>Charlie’s Angels</strong> under her belt, she sure has earned her bragging rights.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Did Trevor Noah And Minka Kelly Fally In Love?</a></span></p><p>Most recently, attention has shifted towards the pair, as it was reported that they had split. While that’s not news, since celebrity breakups are an everyday affair, what surprised the public was that no one had an idea the two were dating in the first place. To feed the curiosity, here’s everything we know about Trevor Noah and Minka Kelly’s Relationship:</p><h2 id=they-were-both-deep-in-singlehood><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>They Were Both Deep In Singlehood</span></h2><p>Prior to news about the couple’s relationship, both Trevor and Minka were single. Minka ended her relationship with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">former Grey's Anatomy star ,Jesse Williams </a>in 2017. Trevor, on the other hand, had been dating Jordyn Taylor for three years. In 2018, news broke that the pair had called it quits. In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with Sophia Reed</a>, Taylor dished out on what it’s like to date a successful man like Trevor Noah.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Trevor Noah Amassed His $100 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=it-s-serious-a-little-birdie-told-people-magazine><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>‘It’s Serious,’ A Little Birdie Told People Magazine</span></h2><p>News of Trevor Noah and Minka Kelly being a couple was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">first broken by People Magazine</a>. An unnamed source told the publication that the romance between Trevor Noah and Minka Kelly was ‘serious.’ The source also added that Trevor and Kelly were very happy. When People reached out to the pair’s representatives for comments, their efforts proved to be futile.</p><h2 id=september-2020-they-were-first-spotted-together><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>September 2020: They Were First Spotted Together</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite how private and low-key the couple wanted to maintain their relationship, that’s just not how these things work. The paparazzi are always working overtime. In September of 2020, the two were seen leaving an SUV and making their way to Noah’s New York apartment. The clear stills showed Noah in a grey hoodie and a pair of blue jeans, while Minka followed closely behind with a set of bags. Kelly’s puppy had its leash held by Trevor.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This Is Why Minka Kelly Quit 'Friday Night Lights'</a></span></p><h2 id=and-considered-moving-in-together><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>And Considered Moving In Together</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Wendy Williams, Minka Kelly and Trevor Noah considered moving in together. This came as a surprise since Trevor Noah, in an interview with Howard Stern, revealed he wasn’t too keen on moving in with a partner. “I think one of the reasons people get divorced is because of this cohabiting bull*** that we’ve come to believe is the way relationships are supposed to be.” Trevor said.</p><h2 id=so-trevor-purchased-a-bel--air-mansion><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>So Trevor Purchased A Bel- Air Mansion</span></h2><p>You can trust Trevor Noah to go big or go home. In the wake of news that the two were shopping for a house, The Daily Show cheques came in handy. Trevor purchased a mansion in the posh neighborhood of Bel-Air that reportedly cost $27.5 million. The 11,000 square foot house has a scenic view of the Pacific Ocean. An anonymous source told people they were ‘making plans for a future together.’</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-marked-trevor-noah-s-birthday><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>They Marked Trevor Noah’s Birthday</span></h2><p>Early this year, The Daily Show host Trevor Noah marked his 37th birthday. On the day of his birthday, Minka Kelly was spotted leaving a Party City. Kelly was dressed in a white shirt and a blue pair of jeans. She’d accessorized her outfit with a brown sling bag, while she carried colorful balloons for the birthday boy in one hand. Later that evening, Kelly and Noah were seen at a local In-N-Out drive-thru, where they ordered cheeseburgers.</p><h2 id=and-said-not-a-word-to-the-press><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>And Said Not A Word To The Press</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Trevor Noah has been known to keep it hush-hush when he’s dating. Rarely does he make a comment about his private life. Speaking to Howard Stern, Trevor Noah said, “ I’m not a fan of celebrity. I am lucky, I gravitate towards real people in life.” That would explain why the news of the couple’s break up was a shocker, as the paparazzi had to dig hard to confirm the pair’s romance.</p><h2 id=then-news-of-their-split-broke><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Then News Of Their Split Broke</span></h2><p>In mid-May, the internet woke up to the news that the couple had decided to call it a day. According to Entertainment Tonight, an anonymous source revealed that Noah and Kelly needed to take time apart. “Their work commitment and careers are very different and their both feel like they should take time apart.” The source said, adding that Kelly was ‘leaning on friends and keeping busy since their split.’</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=but-they-were-trying-to-figure-things-out><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>But They Were "Trying To Figure Things Out"</span></h2><p>At the beginning of the month, Trevor and Minka Kelly were reportedly trying to figure things out, according to People. An anonymous source revealed that though the couple wasn’t officially back together, they were all lovey-dovey while on vacation on the Caribbean Island. The St. Barts visit was a sign that it wasn't the last we'd see of them.</p><h2 id=and-went-on-a-double-date><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>And Went On A Double Date</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Trevor Noah has sworn off PDA, he seems to be breaking his own rules when it comes to his relationship with Minka Kelly. Only a week ago, the couple was seen holding hands in public, in the company of friends. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In a shot by TMZ,</a> the two couples were spotted at a Shushi joint in New York, on what seemed to be a double date.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Show With Trevor Now Goes Fully Remote With New Episodes</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirq52mpL9uus6an2aZnpl6rrXNpJhmo5Whubp51qGcq51dqbWmtdFmqZ6kkam2sLrSoaCpZaOprq%2Bw0marqJyRrnw%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftrevor-noah-and-minka-kelly-where-their-relationship-stands-today.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2ftrevor-noah-and-minka-kelly-where-their-relationship-stands-today.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2ftrevor-noah-and-minka-kelly-where-their-relationship-stands-today.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2ftrevor-noah-and-minka-kelly-where-their-relationship-stands-today.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftrevor-noah-and-minka-kelly-where-their-relationship-stands-today.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftrevor-noah-and-minka-kelly-where-their-relationship-stands-today.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./what-did-charles-slacks-do-army-veteran-charged-over-domestic-shooting.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./what-did-charles-slacks-do-army-veteran-charged-over-domestic-shooting.html>What did Charles Slacks do?
